## Section I - Multiple Choice Solutions

### Question 1
**Topic:** Gravitational Fields
**Answer:** D

**Solution:**
Gravitational field strength is given by:
$$g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$

Where:
- G = gravitational constant
- M = mass of Earth (constant)
- r = distance from Earth's center

As altitude increases, r increases, so g decreases. This is due to the inverse square relationship with distance from Earth's center.

### Question 2
**Topic:** Transformers and Power Transmission
**Answer:** C

**Solution:**
For efficient power transmission:
- At power station: Use step-up transformer to increase voltage and decrease current
- At houses: Use step-down transformer to decrease voltage and increase current
- High voltage transmission reduces power loss: $$P_{loss} = I^2R$$

Correct sequence: Power station ‚Üí Step-up transformer ‚Üí High voltage/Low current transmission ‚Üí Step-down transformer ‚Üí Houses

### Question 3
**Topic:** Wave Interference - Young's Double Slit
**Answer:** B

**Solution:**
Double-slit experiment produces interference pattern with:
- Bright central maximum
- Alternating bright and dark fringes
- Symmetrical pattern

Pattern B shows the characteristic interference pattern with central bright fringe and symmetric side fringes.

---

### Question 4
**Topic:** Radioactive Decay
**Answer:** B

**Solution:**
Half-life = 30 years
Time elapsed = 90 years = 3 half-lives

After each half-life, mass reduces by half:
- After 30 years: 120g ‚Üí 60g
- After 60 years: 60g ‚Üí 30g  
- After 90 years: 30g ‚Üí 15g

Using the formula: $$N = N_0 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/t_{1/2}}$$
$$N = 120 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{90/30} = 120 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 120 \times \frac{1}{8} = 15\text{ g}$$

### Question 5
**Topic:** Kepler's Second Law
**Answer:** A

**Solution:**
Kepler's Second Law: Equal areas are swept in equal times.
When farther from star (at aphelion), planet moves slower.
When closer to star (at perihelion), planet moves faster.

From the diagram, P-Q represents the furthest distance from the star, so the planet moves slowest here, taking the greatest time.

---

### Question 6
**Topic:** Electromagnetic Wave Generation
**Answer:** D

**Solution:**
Electromagnetic waves are produced by accelerating charges.

Analysis of options:
- A: Stationary electron - no acceleration, no EM wave
- B: Stable orbit - no net acceleration (balanced forces)
- C: Constant velocity - no acceleration
- D: Circular motion - continuous centripetal acceleration

Only option D involves acceleration (centripetal acceleration in circular motion).

---

### Question 7
**Topic:** de Broglie Wavelength
**Answer:** C

**Solution:**
de Broglie wavelength: $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}$$

Given: Both particles have same speed (v)
- Mass of proton ‚âà 1.007 u
- Mass of neutron ‚âà 1.009 u

Since neutron has greater mass and same speed:
- Neutron has greater momentum (p = mv)
- Neutron has shorter wavelength (Œª = h/p)

---

### Question 8
**Topic:** Projectile Motion
**Answer:** B

**Solution:**
To reach position B (further horizontal distance), the projectile needs:
- Greater horizontal velocity component
- Same vertical motion (same height)

This can be achieved by increasing the launch angle, which:
- Increases horizontal component initially
- Maintains appropriate flight time
- Doesn't require changing mass or height

---

### Question 9
**Topic:** Blackbody Radiation
**Answer:** A

**Solution:**
Wien's Displacement Law: $$\lambda_{max} = \frac{b}{T}$$
Stefan-Boltzmann Law: $$P = \sigma AT^4$$

For lower temperature (4000K vs 4500K):
- Peak wavelength shifts to longer wavelengths
- Total power/intensity decreases at all wavelengths
- Overall intensity is less across the entire spectrum

---

### Question 10
**Topic:** Magnetic Forces and Torque
**Answer:** A

**Solution:**
Force on current-carrying conductor: $$F = BIL\sin\theta$$

In Figure I: Side XY is perpendicular to magnetic field
In Figure II: Side XY is parallel to magnetic field

- Force in Figure I: $$F_I = BIL\sin(90¬∞) = BIL$$
- Force in Figure II: $$F_{II} = BIL\sin(0¬∞) = 0$$

Therefore: $$F_I > F_{II}$$

For torque: Both figures show the loop at same angle to field, so torque is equal.

---

### Question 11
**Topic:** Nuclear Decay Series
**Answer:** A

**Solution:**
From ¬≤¬≥‚Å∏U to X:
- Mass number: 238 ‚Üí 234 (decrease of 4)
- Atomic number: 92 ‚Üí 90 (decrease of 2)
- This indicates alpha decay (‚Å¥‚ÇÇHe emission)
- X = ¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Çâ‚ÇÄTh

From ¬≤¬≥‚Å¥Th to Y:
- Mass number: 234 ‚Üí 234 (no change)
- Atomic number: 90 ‚Üí 91 (increase of 1)
- This indicates beta decay (electron emission)
- Y = ¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Çâ‚ÇÅPa

---

### Question 12
**Topic:** Electric Potential Energy
**Answer:** B

**Solution:**
Work done by electric field: $$W = qEd = q \cdot \frac{V}{d} \cdot d = qV$$

In Figure I: Particle travels distance d, gains energy W
In Figure II: Same voltage, but plates are 2d apart
- Electric field strength: $$E = \frac{V}{2d}$$
- Work done over distance d: $$W' = qE \cdot d = q \cdot \frac{V}{2d} \cdot d = \frac{qV}{2} = \frac{W}{2}$$

---

### Question 13
**Topic:** Nuclear Binding Energy
**Answer:** A

**Solution:**
Binding energy represents the energy required to separate nucleons.
Higher binding energy = more stable nucleus
Lower binding energy = less stable nucleus

If nucleus X has greater binding energy than nucleus Y, then X is more stable than Y.

---

### Question 14
**Topic:** Escape Velocity
**Answer:** C

**Solution:**
Escape velocity formula: $$v_{escape} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}$$

For Planet X:
- Mass = 4M_Earth
- Radius = 3r_Earth

$$v_X = \sqrt{\frac{2G(4M_Earth)}{3r_Earth}} = \sqrt{\frac{8GM_Earth}{3r_Earth}}$$

$$v_X = \sqrt{\frac{8}{3}} \times \sqrt{\frac{GM_Earth}{r_Earth}} = \sqrt{\frac{8}{3}} \times \frac{v_Earth}{\sqrt{2}}$$

$$v_X = \sqrt{\frac{8}{3 \times 2}} \times v_Earth = \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}} \times 11.2$$

$$v_X = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \times 11.2 = 1.155 \times 11.2 = 12.9 \text{ km/s}$$

---

### Question 15
**Topic:** Photoelectric Effect
**Answer:** A

**Solution:**
Einstein's photon model explains:
- Threshold frequency exists below which no photoelectrons are emitted
- This corresponds to a maximum wavelength above which no emission occurs
- Energy depends on frequency, not intensity

Option A correctly describes the wavelength threshold consistent with Einstein's quantum model.

---

### Question 16
**Topic:** Magnetic Forces Between Currents
**Answer:** C

**Solution:**
For rod Y to remain stationary:
- Magnetic force on Y must balance its weight (upward force needed)
- By Newton's third law, Y exerts equal and opposite force on X (downward)
- Table must support: Weight of X + Weight of Y + Magnetic force from Y

Therefore, table force = total weight of both rods.

---

### Question 17
**Topic:** Simple Harmonic Motion - Torque
**Answer:** B

**Solution:**
Torque in pendulum: $$\tau = -mg\ell\sin\theta$$

- At Y (equilibrium): Œ∏ = 0, so œÑ = 0
- At X and Z (maximum displacement): Œ∏ = maximum, so |œÑ| = maximum
- Torque is restoring (always toward equilibrium)

---

### Question 18
**Topic:** Motion in Fields
**Answer:** C

**Solution:**
Force in gravitational field: $$F = mg$$ (independent of mass for same g)
Force in electric field: $$F = qE$$ (independent of mass)

When mass increases:
- Gravitational field: Same acceleration (g independent of mass)
- Electric field: Same acceleration (a = qE/m, but since q and E constant, path unchanged)

Both paths remain the same when mass increases.

---

### Question 19
**Topic:** Special Relativity - Reference Frames
**Answer:** B

**Solution:**
From reference frame of positive charge in wire Y:
- Wire Y appears stationary
- Wire X appears to move (length contraction effects)
- Current direction affects apparent charge distribution
- Relativistic effects cause apparent charge separation

This requires detailed relativity analysis, but option B shows the correct relative charge distribution.

---

### Question 20
**Topic:** Cosmology - Accelerating Universe
**Answer:** A

**Solution:**
Accelerating expansion means:
- Velocity increases with time for same distance
- Graph should curve upward (increasing slope)
- More distant galaxies show greater deviation from linear relationship

Option A shows the upward curvature consistent with accelerating expansion.

### Question 22 (3 marks)
**Topic:** Time Dilation

**Given:**
- Spacecraft speed: v = 0.9c
- Proper time interval: Œît‚ÇÄ = 3.1 √ó 10‚Åª‚Åπ s

**Solution:**
Time dilation formula:
$$\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

$$\Delta t = \frac{3.1 \times 10^{-9}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.9c)^2}{c^2}}}$$

$$\Delta t = \frac{3.1 \times 10^{-9}}{\sqrt{1-0.81}}$$

$$\Delta t = \frac{3.1 \times 10^{-9}}{\sqrt{0.19}}$$

$$\Delta t = \frac{3.1 \times 10^{-9}}{0.436} = 7.1 \times 10^{-9} \text{ s}$$

**Answer:** The time between pulses as measured by Earth observer is **7.1 √ó 10‚Åª‚Åπ s**

### Question 23 (7 marks)
**Topic:** Gravitational Force, Photon Energy, Blackbody Temperature

**(a) Gravitational force (2 marks):**

**Given:**
- Mass of JWST: m = 6.1 √ó 10¬≥ kg
- Distance from Sun: r = 1.52 √ó 10¬π¬π m  
- Mass of Sun: M = 1.99 √ó 10¬≥‚Å∞ kg
- G = 6.67 √ó 10‚Åª¬π¬π N‚ãÖm¬≤/kg¬≤

$$F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$

$$F = \frac{(6.67 \times 10^{-11})(1.99 \times 10^{30})(6.1 \times 10^3)}{(1.52 \times 10^{11})^2}$$

$$F = \frac{8.09 \times 10^{23}}{2.31 \times 10^{22}} = 3.5 \times 10^1 = 35 \text{ N}$$

**(b) Minimum photon energy (3 marks):**

**Given:** Maximum wavelength: Œª = 2.8 √ó 10‚Åª‚Åµ m

$$E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$

$$E = \frac{(6.63 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{2.8 \times 10^{-5}}$$

$$E = \frac{1.989 \times 10^{-25}}{2.8 \times 10^{-5}} = 7.1 \times 10^{-21} \text{ J}$$

**(c) Exoplanet temperature (2 marks):**

**Given:** Peak wavelength: Œª‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì = 1.14 √ó 10‚Åª‚Åµ m

Wien's Law: $$\lambda_{max} = \frac{b}{T}$$

Where b = 2.898 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥ m‚ãÖK

$$T = \frac{b}{\lambda_{max}} = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{1.14 \times 10^{-5}} = 254 \text{ K}$$

### Question 24 (3 marks)
**Topic:** Magnetic Force on Moving Charge

**Given:**
- Electron speed: v = 3.0 √ó 10‚Å∂ m/s
- Path radius: r = 10 m
- Electron charge: e = 1.60 √ó 10‚Åª¬π‚Åπ C
- Electron mass: m‚Çë = 9.11 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥¬π kg

**Solution:**
For circular motion, magnetic force provides centripetal force:

$$F_{magnetic} = F_{centripetal}$$
$$qvB = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

Solving for B:
$$B = \frac{mv}{qr}$$

$$B = \frac{(9.11 \times 10^{-31})(3.0 \times 10^6)}{(1.60 \times 10^{-19})(10)}$$

$$B = \frac{2.73 \times 10^{-24}}{1.60 \times 10^{-18}} = 1.7 \times 10^{-6} \text{ T}$$

**Answer:** The required magnetic field is **1.7 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∂ T**

---

### Question 25 (4 marks)
**Topic:** DC Motors

**(a) Function of part X (2 marks):**
Part X is a **commutator**. Its function is to:
- Reverse the direction of current in the coil every half rotation
- Ensure the torque always acts in the same direction
- Convert the alternating current induced in the rotating coil into direct current in the external circuit

**(b) Why torque decreases as speed increases (2 marks):**
As the motor speeds up:
- The rotating coil cuts through magnetic field lines faster
- This induces a back EMF that opposes the applied voltage: $$\varepsilon_{back} = BLv$$
- The net voltage across the coil decreases: $$V_{net} = V_{applied} - \varepsilon_{back}$$
- Current decreases: $$I = \frac{V_{net}}{R}$$
- Since torque ‚àù current, the torque decreases: $$\tau = BIL$$

### Question 26 (3 marks)
**Topic:** Nuclear Reactions - Q Value

**Given reaction:** ¬π¬≤‚ÇÜC + ¬π‚ÇÅH ‚Üí ‚Åπ‚ÇÖB + ‚Å¥‚ÇÇHe

**Given masses:**
- ¬π¬≤‚ÇÜC: 12.064 u
- ¬π‚ÇÅH: 1.008 u  
- ‚Åπ‚ÇÖB: 9.013 u
- ‚Å¥‚ÇÇHe: 4.003 u

**Solution:**
Calculate mass defect:
$$\Delta m = (m_{initial}) - (m_{final})$$
$$\Delta m = (12.064 + 1.008) - (9.013 + 4.003)$$
$$\Delta m = 13.072 - 13.016 = 0.056 \text{ u}$$

Convert to energy:

### Question 27 (8 marks)
**Topic:** Stellar Spectroscopy

**(a) How composition and temperature are determined (4 marks):**

**Composition determination:**
- Stars produce absorption line spectra when light passes through stellar atmospheres
- Each element produces characteristic absorption lines at specific wavelengths
- By comparing observed absorption lines to known laboratory spectra, we can identify which elements are present
- The strength (depth) of absorption lines indicates the relative abundance of elements

**Temperature determination:**
- The continuous spectrum follows blackbody radiation curves
- Peak wavelength is related to temperature by Wien's Law: Œª‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì = b/T
- The overall shape and intensity distribution of the continuous spectrum indicates surface temperature
- Hotter stars appear blue-white, cooler stars appear red

**(b) Effects of stellar rotation (4 marks):**

**Explanation:**
Stellar rotation causes Doppler broadening of spectral lines because:
- One side of the star rotates toward us (blue-shifted)
- The other side rotates away from us (red-shifted)
- This creates a range of Doppler shifts across the stellar disk
- The spectral line becomes broadened rather than sharp

**Modified diagram should show:**
- Original sharp line at 656 nm
- Broadened line spanning slightly shorter and longer wavelengths
- Maintained center at 656 nm but with wider profile

### Question 28 (5 marks)
**Topic:** Transformers

**Given:**
- Primary voltage: 240 V
- Primary turns: N‚Çö = 300
- Secondary turns: N‚Çõ = 50

**(a) Voltage across globe X with switch open (2 marks):**

Transformer equation:
$$\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \frac{N_s}{N_p}$$

$$V_s = V_p \times \frac{N_s}{N_p} = 240 \times \frac{50}{300} = 240 \times \frac{1}{6} = 40 \text{ V}$$

**Answer:** Voltage across globe X is **40 V**

**(b) Why primary current changes when switch closes (3 marks):**

When the switch is open:
- No current flows in secondary circuit
- Primary draws only magnetizing current (very small)

When switch closes:
- Current flows through globe Y in secondary circuit
- This creates changing magnetic flux in the core
- By Lenz's law, primary must draw additional current to maintain flux balance
- Primary current increases to: $$I_p = I_s \times \frac{N_s}{N_p}$$
- The primary current increases to supply power to the load in the secondary

### Question 29 (4 marks)
**Topic:** Polarization of Light

**Explanation:**
Incandescent light is unpolarized, meaning it contains electric field vectors oscillating in all directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

A polarizing filter only allows light waves with electric field vectors aligned in one specific direction (the transmission axis) to pass through.

Since unpolarized light has equal intensity components in all directions, only the component parallel to the transmission axis passes through. On average, this is exactly half the original intensity.

The intensity reduction follows Malus's Law for unpolarized light:
$$I = \frac{I_0}{2}$$

Where I‚ÇÄ is the original intensity and I is the transmitted intensity.

This phenomenon demonstrates the transverse wave nature of light and proves that light waves have electric field components perpendicular to their direction of travel.

### Question 30 (8 marks)
**Topic:** Electromagnetic Induction

**(a) Force on ring X (4 marks):**

From 0 to 0.05 seconds:
- The current in the electromagnet increases steadily
- This creates an increasing magnetic field through ring X
- By Faraday's law, changing magnetic flux induces EMF: $$\varepsilon = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$$
- The induced EMF creates an induced current in the complete ring X
- By Lenz's law, this induced current opposes the change in flux
- The induced current creates a magnetic field opposing the increase
- This results in a repulsive force between the electromagnet and ring X
- The ring experiences a force away from the electromagnet throughout this period

**(b)(i) Behavior of ring Y (2 marks):**

Ring Y has a gap, so no complete current path exists. Therefore:
- No induced current can flow around the ring
- No magnetic forces act on the ring
- Ring Y remains stationary and unaffected by the changing magnetic field

**(b)(ii) Maximum induced EMF in ring Y (2 marks):**

From the graph, maximum rate of change occurs from 0 to 0.01 s:
$$\frac{dB}{dt} = \frac{8 \times 10^{-3} - 0}{0.01 - 0} = 0.8 \text{ T/s}$$

Using Faraday's law:
$$\varepsilon = -A\frac{dB}{dt}$$
$$|\varepsilon| = (4 \times 10^{-4}) \times 0.8 = 3.2 \times 10^{-4} \text{ V}$$

**Answer:** Maximum induced EMF is **3.2 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å¥ V**

---

### Question 31 (5 marks)
**Topic:** Electromagnetic Braking

**Analysis of the acceleration graphs:**

**Similarities:**
- Both curves show exponential decay in acceleration magnitude
- Both start with maximum negative acceleration and approach zero
- Both follow similar mathematical form (exponential approach to equilibrium)
- Both show the same type of electromagnetic braking behavior

**Differences:**
- Higher initial speed (12 m/s) produces greater initial acceleration magnitude (~8.5 m/s¬≤)
- Lower initial speed (10 m/s) produces smaller initial acceleration magnitude (~6 m/s¬≤)
- The 12 m/s curve takes longer to reach near-zero acceleration

**Physical explanation:**
- Electromagnetic braking force depends on velocity: F ‚àù v
- Higher velocity creates stronger induced currents in the aluminum fin
- Stronger currents produce greater magnetic forces and higher deceleration
- As velocity decreases, induced currents decrease, reducing braking force
- This creates the exponential decay pattern in both cases
- The system naturally approaches terminal conditions where braking force becomes negligible

### Question 32 (7 marks)
**Topic:** Projectile Motion with Rotating Reference Frame

**Given:**
- Disc rotation: 3 rev/s = 3 √ó 2œÄ = 6œÄ rad/s
- Launch radius: 2 m
- Launch velocity: 5.72 m/s (vertical)
- g = 9.8 m/s¬≤

**Step 1: Find flight time**
For vertical motion: $$v = u + gt$$
At maximum height: $$0 = 5.72 - 9.8t_{up}$$
$$t_{up} = \frac{5.72}{9.8} = 0.584 \text{ s}$$

Total flight time: $$t_{total} = 2 \times 0.584 = 1.168 \text{ s}$$

**Step 2: Find launcher's new position**
Angular displacement of launcher:
$$\theta = \omega t = 6\pi \times 1.168 = 7.008\pi \text{ rad}$$
$$\theta = 7.008\pi = 22.0 \text{ rad} = 3.5 \times 2\pi + 0.008\pi$$

Net angular displacement: $$\Delta\theta = 0.008\pi = 0.025 \text{ rad}$$

**Step 3: Find launcher's linear displacement**
Arc length: $$s = r\theta = 2 \times 0.025 = 0.050 \text{ m}$$

**Step 4: Ball's position relative to launcher**
The ball lands at its original launch position (directly above in Earth frame).
The launcher has moved 0.050 m tangentially.

**Answer:** The ball lands **0.050 m behind the launcher's new position** (opposite to direction of rotation).

### Question 34 (9 marks)
**Topic:** Satellite Orbital Mechanics

**Given:**
- Mass: m = 400 kg
- Initial orbit radius: r‚ÇÅ = 6.700 √ó 10‚Å∂ m
- Initial potential energy: U‚ÇÅ = -2.389 √ó 10¬π‚Å∞ J
- Initial total energy: E‚ÇÅ = -1.195 √ó 10¬π‚Å∞ J
- Kinetic energy increase: ŒîKE = 5.232 √ó 10‚Å∏ J
- Point Q radius: r‚ÇÇ = 6.850 √ó 10‚Å∂ m

**(a) Qualitative energy analysis P to Q (2 marks):**

As the satellite moves from P to Q:
- **Kinetic energy decreases** - satellite slows down as it moves away from Earth against gravitational attraction
- **Potential energy increases** (becomes less negative) - satellite gains gravitational potential energy as distance from Earth increases
- **Total mechanical energy remains constant** - no external forces act on the satellite after engine shutdown

**(b) Show kinetic energy at Q = 1.194 √ó 10¬π‚Å∞ J (4 marks):**

**Step 1:** Find initial kinetic energy at P
$$KE_1 = E_1 - U_1 = -1.195 \times 10^{10} - (-2.389 \times 10^{10})$$
$$KE_1 = 1.194 \times 10^{10} \text{ J}$$

**Step 2:** Find kinetic energy after engine firing
$$KE_{after} = KE_1 + \Delta KE = 1.194 \times 10^{10} + 5.232 \times 10^8$$
$$KE_{after} = 1.194 \times 10^{10} + 0.5232 \times 10^{10} = 1.717 \times 10^{10} \text{ J}$$

**Step 3:** Find new total energy
$$E_{new} = KE_{after} + U_1 = 1.717 \times 10^{10} + (-2.389 \times 10^{10})$$
$$E_{new} = -6.72 \times 10^9 \text{ J}$$

**Step 4:** Find potential energy at Q
$$U_2 = \frac{GMm}{r_2} \times \frac{U_1}{GMm/r_1} = U_1 \times \frac{r_1}{r_2}$$
$$U_2 = -2.389 \times 10^{10} \times \frac{6.700 \times 10^6}{6.850 \times 10^6}$$
$$U_2 = -2.336 \times 10^{10} \text{ J}$$

**Step 5:** Find kinetic energy at Q
$$KE_2 = E_{new} - U_2 = -6.72 \times 10^9 - (-2.336 \times 10^{10})$$
$$KE_2 = 1.664 \times 10^{10} \text{ J}$$

Wait, let me recalculate this more carefully:

Actually, using energy conservation:
$$E_{new} = E_1 + \Delta KE = -1.195 \times 10^{10} + 5.232 \times 10^8 = -6.718 \times 10^9 \text{ J}$$

At point Q:
$$U_2 = -\frac{GMm}{r_2} = U_1 \times \frac{r_1}{r_2} = -2.389 \times 10^{10} \times \frac{6.700}{6.850} = -2.336 \times 10^{10} \text{ J}$$

$$KE_2 = E_{new} - U_2 = -6.718 \times 10^9 - (-2.336 \times 10^{10}) = 1.664 \times 10^{10} \text{ J}$$

This doesn't match the given answer. Let me reconsider...

The question asks to show KE = 1.194 √ó 10¬π‚Å∞ J, which suggests there might be an error in my approach or the given values. However, following energy conservation principles with the given
