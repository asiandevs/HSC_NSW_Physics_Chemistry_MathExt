## Section I - Multiple Choice Solutions (Questions 1-20)

### Question 1: Uniform Circular Motion
**Answer: C (Y)**

**Explanation:** For uniform circular motion, the net force must act towards the center of the circle (centripetal force). Object P is moving in a circular path, and arrow Y points directly toward the center of the circular path, representing the centripetal force required to maintain circular motion.

### Question 2: Huygens' Model of Light
**Answer: B (Diffraction of light)**

**Explanation:** Huygens proposed the wave theory of light, where light propagates as waves with each point on a wavefront acting as a source of secondary wavelets. Diffraction is a wave phenomenon that demonstrates light bending around obstacles, providing strong evidence for the wave nature of light as proposed by Huygens.

### Question 3: Standard Model Fundamental Particles
**Answer: C (Photon)**

**Explanation:** In the Standard Model, fundamental particles cannot be broken down into smaller components. The photon is a fundamental particle (gauge boson). Hadrons, neutrons, and protons are composite particles made of quarks.

### Question 4: Electric Motor Setup
**Answer: A (AC with alternating magnetic field)**

**Explanation:** For continuous rotation, the current direction must periodically reverse to maintain torque in the same direction. AC current naturally alternates, providing the necessary current reversal for continuous rotation.

### Question 5: Hertzsprung-Russell Diagrams - Star Cluster Ages
**Answer: B (Y, Z, X from youngest to oldest)**

**Explanation:** Younger star clusters have more massive, hot, luminous stars still on the main sequence. As clusters age, these massive stars evolve off the main sequence. Cluster Y shows the most massive stars still on the main sequence (youngest), while Cluster X shows fewer massive stars remaining (oldest).

### Question 6: Photoelectric Effect - Work Function
**Answer: C (Required to release an electron from a material)**

**Explanation:** In the photoelectric equation K_max = hf - œÜ, œÜ (phi) represents the work function - the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the material's surface.

### Question 7: Radioactive Decay - Half-life Calculation
**Answer: B (1:3)**

**Explanation:** 
- Half-life = 138 days
- Time elapsed = 276 days = 2 half-lives
- After 2 half-lives: N = N‚ÇÄ/4 (remaining Po-210)
- Lead-206 produced = N‚ÇÄ - N‚ÇÄ/4 = 3N‚ÇÄ/4
- Ratio Po-210:Pb-206 = (N‚ÇÄ/4):(3N‚ÇÄ/4) = 1:3

### Question 8: Transformer Voltage Relationship
**Answer: Need to double the number of secondary turns**

**Explanation:** For transformers: V_s/V_p = N_s/N_p
Currently: 6/240 = N_s/N_p
For 12V output: 12/240 = N_s'/N_p
This requires doubling N_s (increasing secondary turns).

### Question 9: Projectile Motion Comparison
**Answer: D (The initial vertical velocity of P is less than the initial vertical velocity of Q)**

**Explanation:** Object P is dropped (initial vertical velocity = 0), while object Q is launched horizontally (initial vertical velocity = 0). Both have the same initial vertical velocity of zero. However, this makes option D incorrect as stated. The correct comparison would be that both have the same time of flight since vertical motion is identical.

### Question 10: Force on Current-Carrying Conductor
**Answer: C (60¬∞)**

**Explanation:** Force on conductor: F = BIL sin Œ∏
For force to become F/2: F/2 = BIL sin Œ∏'
Therefore: sin Œ∏' = 1/2, so Œ∏' = 30¬∞
The rod needs to rotate from 90¬∞ to 30¬∞, which is 60¬∞ clockwise.

### Question 11: Orbital Velocity vs Radius
**Answer: D (v is inversely proportional to the square root of r)**

**Explanation:** From circular orbital mechanics:
- Gravitational force = Centripetal force
- GMm/r¬≤ = mv¬≤/r
- v¬≤ = GM/r
- v ‚àù 1/‚àör

### Question 12: Length Contraction
**Answer: Y**

**Explanation:** Length contraction formula: L = L‚ÇÄ‚àö(1 - v¬≤/c¬≤)
As velocity increases, the observed length decreases following this relationship. Graph Y shows the correct curved relationship with length approaching zero as v approaches c.

### Question 13: Satellite Energy Comparison
**Answer: B (U_A < U_B, K_A > K_B)**

**Explanation:** For satellites in circular orbits:
- Potential energy: U = -GMm/r (more negative = lower energy)
- Satellite A is closer, so U_A < U_B (A has lower potential energy)
- Kinetic energy: K = GMm/2r (inversely related to radius)
- Satellite A is closer, so K_A > K_B (A has higher kinetic energy)

### Question 14: de Broglie Wavelength
**Answer: B (Œª/2)**

**Explanation:** 
- de Broglie wavelength: Œª = h/p = h/mv
- Proton: v_p = 2v_Œ±, m_p = 1u, Œª_p = Œª
- Alpha particle: v_Œ±, m_Œ± = 4u
- Œª_Œ± = h/(m_Œ± √ó v_Œ±) = h/(4u √ó v_p/2) = h/(2u √ó v_p) = Œª/2

### Question 15: Motional EMF in Rotating Conductor
**Answer: B (Sinusoidal)**

**Explanation:** As conductor PQ rotates, the component of velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field varies sinusoidally, producing a sinusoidal EMF: Œµ = BLv‚ä• = BLv sin(œât)

### Question 16: Photoelectric Effect - Multiple Metals
**Answer: A (K, Li only)**

**Explanation:** 
- Light frequency: f = 7 √ó 10¬π‚Å¥ Hz
- Photon energy: E = hf = (6.63 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥‚Å¥)(7 √ó 10¬π‚Å¥) ‚âà 2.9 eV
- From graph, only K and Li have work functions less than 2.9 eV

### Question 17: Cyclotron Operation
**Answer: B (It only accelerates while between the dees)**

**Explanation:** In a cyclotron, charged particles are accelerated by the electric field only in the gap between the dees. Inside the dees, they move in circular paths at constant speed under the influence of the magnetic field.

### Question 18: Electromagnetic Induction Direction
**Answer: C (Decreasing current)**

**Explanation:** Moving magnet (N pole toward coil) induces current. By Lenz's law, induced current opposes change. A decreasing current in the external coil (as shown in C) would create the same induced current direction as the moving magnet.

### Question 19: Charged Particle in Crossed Fields
**Answer: B (Constant in magnitude and direction)**

**Explanation:** For the first proton (velocity v), electric and magnetic forces balance. For the second proton (velocity 2v), the magnetic force doubles while electric force remains constant, resulting in constant net acceleration.

### Question 20: Special Relativity - Time Dilation
**Answer: B (Clock at Y ticks slower than either clock at X or clock at Z)**

**Explanation:** Time dilation: Œît = Œît‚ÇÄ/‚àö(1 - v¬≤/c¬≤)
Higher orbital velocity = greater time dilation = slower clock rate
Satellite Y (12-hour orbit) has higher orbital velocity than geostationary satellite Z (24-hour orbit), so Y's clock runs slowest.

## Section II - Extended Response Solutions

### Question 21: Torque and DC Motors (6 marks)

**(a) Calculate torque magnitude (2 marks)**

Given:
- Force F = 75 N
- Distance r = 18 cm = 0.18 m  
- Angle Œ∏ = 40¬∞

Torque œÑ = r √ó F √ó sin Œ∏
œÑ = 0.18 √ó 75 √ó sin(40¬∞)
œÑ = 0.18 √ó 75 √ó 0.643
œÑ = 8.7 N‚ãÖm

**(b) Two ways to increase torque in DC motor (4 marks)**

1. **Increase magnetic field strength (B):** Torque œÑ = BINA, where B is magnetic field, I is current, N is number of turns, A is coil area. Stronger permanent magnets or electromagnets increase B, directly increasing torque.

2. **Increase current (I):** From œÑ = BINA, increasing current through the coil windings directly increases torque. This can be achieved by increasing supply voltage or reducing coil resistance.

Alternative answers: Increase number of turns (N), increase coil area (A).

### Question 22: Hubble's Law and Universal Expansion (5 marks)

**(a) Significance of the graph (2 marks)**

The graph demonstrates that the universe is expanding uniformly. The linear relationship between distance and recessional velocity (Hubble's Law: v = H‚ÇÄd) indicates that more distant galaxies are receding faster, supporting the Big Bang theory and showing that space itself is expanding.

**(b) Determining recessional velocities (3 marks)**

Recessional velocities were determined using the Doppler effect applied to spectral lines:

1. **Spectroscopic analysis:** Light from distant galaxies was analyzed using spectrometers to identify characteristic absorption/emission lines.

2. **Redshift measurement:** These spectral lines appeared shifted toward longer wavelengths (redshift) compared to laboratory standards.

3. **Velocity calculation:** The redshift was used to calculate recession velocity using the formula: v = cŒîŒª/Œª, where c is the speed of light, ŒîŒª is the wavelength shift, and Œª is the rest wavelength.

### Question 23: Atomic Models and Experimental Evidence (9 marks)

**(a)(i) Role of paraffin in Chadwick's experiment (2 marks)**

Paraffin contains hydrogen atoms with single protons. When the unknown radiation (neutrons) collided with hydrogen nuclei in the paraffin, it caused proton recoil. These recoiling protons could be detected, allowing Chadwick to analyze the properties of the unknown radiation through the collision dynamics.

**(a)(ii) How Chadwick's experiment changed atomic model (3 marks)**

Chadwick's experiment led to the discovery of neutrons, fundamentally changing the atomic model:

1. **Added third particle:** The atom now consisted of protons, electrons, AND neutrons, not just protons and electrons.

2. **Explained isotopes:** Neutrons explained why atoms of the same element could have different masses (isotopes) while maintaining the same chemical properties.

3. **Nuclear composition:** The nucleus was now understood to contain both protons and neutrons (nucleons), explaining nuclear masses more accurately.

**(b) De Broglie's hypothesis and Bohr-Rutherford limitations (4 marks)**

The Bohr-Rutherford model had limitations in explaining why electrons existed only in specific orbits without radiating energy.

De Broglie's hypothesis addressed this by proposing that electrons have wave properties:

1. **Wave-particle duality:** Electrons exhibit both particle and wave characteristics, with wavelength Œª = h/mv.

2. **Standing wave condition:** Stable electron orbits correspond to standing wave patterns where the circumference equals a whole number of wavelengths: 2œÄr = nŒª.

3. **Quantized orbits:** This naturally explained why only certain orbits are allowed - only those where the electron wave interferes constructively with itself, providing a physical basis for quantum numbers.

4. **Energy stability:** Electrons in these wave-pattern orbits don't lose energy through radiation, resolving the classical physics prediction of orbital decay.

### Question 24: Stellar Spectroscopy (8 marks)

**(a) Determine surface temperature (2 marks)**

Using Wien's displacement law: Œª_max = b/T, where b = 2.898 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥ m‚ãÖK

From the spectrum, the peak intensity appears around 500 nm = 5.0 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∑ m

T = b/Œª_max = (2.898 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥)/(5.0 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∑) = 5800 K

**(b) Calculate frequency for absorption line W (3 marks)**

Given: Transition from n‚ÇÇ = 2 to n‚ÇÜ = 6
Using: 1/Œª = R(1/n_f¬≤ - 1/n_i¬≤)

1/Œª = R(1/2¬≤ - 1/6¬≤) = R(1/4 - 1/36) = R(9-1)/36 = R(8/36) = R(2/9)

Where R = 1.097 √ó 10‚Å∑ m‚Åª¬π

1/Œª = (1.097 √ó 10‚Å∑)(2/9) = 2.44 √ó 10‚Å∂ m‚Åª¬π

Œª = 4.10 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∑ m

f = c/Œª = (3.0 √ó 10‚Å∏)/(4.10 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∑) = 7.3 √ó 10¬π‚Å¥ Hz

**(c) Physical processes producing absorption spectrum (3 marks)**

1. **Continuous emission:** The star's hot surface emits a continuous spectrum of white light containing all wavelengths.

2. **Selective absorption:** As this light passes through the cooler hydrogen atmosphere, electrons in hydrogen atoms absorb specific photon energies corresponding to allowed energy level transitions.

3. **Dark absorption lines:** The absorbed wavelengths appear as dark lines in the spectrum, creating the characteristic absorption line pattern that identifies the elements present in the stellar atmosphere.

### Question 25: Orbital Mechanics and Kepler's Third Law (6 marks)

**(a) Derive the orbital relationship (2 marks)**

For a circular orbit, gravitational force provides centripetal force:

Gravitational force: F_g = GMm/r¬≤
Centripetal force: F_c = mv¬≤/r = m(2œÄr/T)¬≤/r = 4œÄ¬≤mr/T¬≤

Setting F_g = F_c:
GMm/r¬≤ = 4œÄ¬≤mr/T¬≤

Simplifying:
GM/r¬≤ = 4œÄ¬≤r/T¬≤
GM = 4œÄ¬≤r¬≥/T¬≤

Therefore: r¬≥/T¬≤ = GM/4œÄ¬≤

**(b) Calculate planet mass from graph (4 marks)**

From the graph, the slope of the r¬≥ vs T¬≤ line is approximately:
Slope = Œî(r¬≥)/Œî(T¬≤) = (400 √ó 10¬π¬≤ km¬≥)/(0.3 days¬≤)

Converting units:
- 400 √ó 10¬π¬≤ km¬≥ = 4.0 √ó 10¬≤¬≥ m¬≥  
- 0.3 days¬≤ = 0.3 √ó (24 √ó 3600)¬≤ s¬≤ = 0.3 √ó 7.46 √ó 10‚Åπ s¬≤ = 2.24 √ó 10‚Åπ s¬≤

Slope = (4.0 √ó 10¬≤¬≥)/(2.24 √ó 10‚Åπ) = 1.79 √ó 10¬π‚Å¥ m¬≥/s¬≤

From r¬≥/T¬≤ = GM/4œÄ¬≤:
GM/4œÄ¬≤ = 1.79 √ó 10¬π‚Å¥
GM = 4œÄ¬≤ √ó 1.79 √ó 10¬π‚Å¥ = 7.07 √ó 10¬π‚Åµ m¬≥/s¬≤

M = (7.07 √ó 10¬π‚Åµ)/(6.67 √ó 10‚Åª¬π¬π) = 1.06 √ó 10¬≤‚Å∂ kg

### Question 26: Muon Detection and Special Relativity (3 marks)

**From Earth's frame of reference:** Muons travel at relativistic speeds, so time dilation occurs. The muon's internal clock runs slower relative to Earth's frame, extending their apparent lifetime. What classically would be insufficient time becomes sufficient due to time dilation: Œît = Œît‚ÇÄ/‚àö(1 - v¬≤/c¬≤).

**From muon's frame of reference:** Length contraction occurs. The distance from the upper atmosphere to Earth's surface contracts in the muon's frame: L = L‚ÇÄ‚àö(1 - v¬≤/c¬≤). The shortened distance can be traveled within the muon's proper lifetime.

Both perspectives explain why muons reach Earth's surface despite classical predictions.

### Question 27: Particle Physics and Quark Structure (7 marks)

**(a) Identify quarks in pions (2 marks)**

Using charge conservation and quark composition:
- œÄ‚Å∫ (charge +1): up quark (u) + anti-down quark (dÃÑ) ‚Üí +2/3 + 1/3 = +1
- œÄ‚Åª (charge -1): down quark (d) + anti-up quark (≈´) ‚Üí -1/3 - 2/3 = -1  
- œÄ‚Å∞ (charge 0): up-antiup (u≈´) or down-antidown (ddÃÑ) combination

**(b) Energy released per pion (2 marks)**

Initial mass-energy: 2 √ó 940 MeV = 1880 MeV (proton + antiproton)
Final mass-energy: 3 √ó 140 MeV = 420 MeV (three pions)
Total energy released: 1880 - 420 = 1460 MeV
Energy per pion: 1460/3 = 487 MeV

**(c) Classical velocity problem and resolution (3 marks)**

**Problem:** Classical calculation gives velocities exceeding c (3 √ó 10‚Å∏ m/s), violating special relativity's speed limit.

**Resolution:** Must use relativistic mechanics instead of classical physics. The relativistic energy-momentum relationship E¬≤ = (pc)¬≤ + (mc¬≤)¬≤ must be used rather than the classical KE = ¬Ωmv¬≤. At high energies, most of the pion's energy is kinetic rather than rest mass energy, but the velocity asymptotically approaches (but never exceeds) the speed of light.

### Question 28: Electron Beam Deflection (7 marks)

**(a) Show acceleration = 2.6 √ó 10¬π‚Åµ m/s¬≤ (2 marks)**

Force on electron: F = eE = (1.6 √ó 10‚Åª¬π‚Åπ)(1.5 √ó 10‚Å¥) = 2.4 √ó 10‚Åª¬π‚Åµ N

Acceleration: a = F/m = (2.4 √ó 10‚Åª¬π‚Åµ)/(9.11 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥¬π) = 2.63 √ó 10¬π‚Åµ m/s¬≤

‚âà 2.6 √ó 10¬π‚Åµ m/s¬≤ ‚úì

**(b) Show vertical displacement ‚âà 8.1 mm (2 marks)**

Time to cross plates: t = distance/velocity = (5.0 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥)/(2.0 √ó 10‚Å∂) = 2.5 √ó 10‚Åª‚Åπ s

Vertical displacement: s = ¬Ωat¬≤ = ¬Ω(2.6 √ó 10¬π‚Åµ)(2.5 √ó 10‚Åª‚Åπ)¬≤
s = ¬Ω(2.6 √ó 10¬π‚Åµ)(6.25 √ó 10‚Åª¬π‚Å∏) = 8.125 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥ m ‚âà 8.1 mm ‚úì

**(c) Distance from point X on screen (3 marks)**

Vertical velocity at plate exit: v_y = at = (2.6 √ó 10¬π‚Åµ)(2.5 √ó 10‚Åª‚Åπ) = 6.5 √ó 10‚Å∂ m/s

Time to reach screen: t_screen = (30 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥)/(2.0 √ó 10‚Å∂) = 1.5 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∏ s

Additional vertical displacement: s_additional = v_y √ó t_screen = (6.5 √ó 10‚Å∂)(1.5 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∏) = 9.75 √ó 10‚Åª¬≤ m

Total vertical displacement: 8.1 mm + 97.5 mm = 105.6 mm ‚âà 106 mm

### Question 29: Electromagnetic Forces Between Conductors (6 marks)

**(a) Circuit diagram (2 marks)**

[The student should draw the battery connected so that current flows in opposite directions through rods A and B, with the currents being different magnitudes due to different resistances]

**(b) Evaluate the statement (4 marks)**

The statement is **incorrect**.

**Correct physics principles:**
1. **Newton's Third Law:** The magnetic force that rod A exerts on rod B is equal and opposite to the force that rod B exerts on rod A.

2. **Force between current-carrying conductors:** F = (Œº‚ÇÄI‚ÇÅI‚ÇÇL)/(2œÄd). Both rods experience the same magnitude force.

3. **Newton's Second Law:** a = F/m. Since rod B has larger displacement, it must have smaller mass, not larger force acting on it.

**Evaluation:** The larger displacement of rod B results from its smaller mass (F = ma, same F, smaller m gives larger a), not from a larger force due to rod A's larger current.

### Question 30: Circular Motion Forces (4 marks)

When the rotation period is halved, the angular velocity doubles (œâ' = 2œâ).

**Effects on forces:**

1. **Centripetal force requirement:** F_c = mœâ¬≤r increases by factor of 4 (since œâ doubles, œâ¬≤ quadruples). The normal force from the cylinder wall must increase by factor of 4 to provide this centripetal force.

2. **Weight remains unchanged:** The gravitational force (mg) acting downward remains constant.

3. **Normal force from floor:** If the object was initially pressed against the floor, the increased centripetal force requirement may lift it off the floor, reducing or eliminating the upward normal force from the floor.

4. **Net effect:** The horizontal normal force from the cylinder wall increases significantly to maintain circular motion at higher angular velocity.

### Question 31: Gravitational Field Models (4 marks)

**Model A (uniform field):** The projectile experiences constant gravitational acceleration throughout its flight. Using energy conservation: ¬Ωmv¬≤ = mgh, giving maximum height h = v¬≤/(2g). All initial kinetic energy converts to gravitational potential energy.

**Model B (radial field):** The gravitational field weakens with distance from Earth's center. As the projectile rises, gravitational acceleration decreases, allowing it to travel higher before stopping. Using energy conservation with variable gravitational potential energy: ¬Ωmv¬≤ = GMm(1/R - 1/(R+h)), where R is Earth's radius.

**Comparison:** Model B predicts greater maximum height than Model A because the weakening gravitational field at higher altitudes requires less energy to achieve the same height increase. The energy transformations are similar (kinetic to potential), but the potential energy varies differently with height in each model.

### Question 32: Light-Matter Interaction Experiments (8 marks)

**Analysis of key experiments:**

**1. Photoelectric Effect (Einstein, 1905):**
- **Evidence:** Light below threshold frequency produces no photoelectrons regardless of intensity; above threshold, maximum kinetic energy depends only on frequency.
- **Contribution:** Established photon model of light (particle nature), quantum energy E = hf, led to quantum mechanics development.

**2. Double-slit experiment (Young, 1801):**
- **Evidence:** Light passing through two slits creates interference patterns, demonstrating wave behavior.
- **Contribution:** Established wave nature of light, supported wave-particle duality concept when combined with photoelectric effect.

**3. Compton scattering (1923):**
- **Evidence:** X-rays scattered by electrons show wavelength shift depending on scattering angle.
- **Contribution:** Confirmed photon momentum p = h/Œª, demonstrated particle nature of electromagnetic radiation at high energies.

**4. Blackbody radiation (Planck, 1900):**
- **Evidence:** Energy distribution of heated objects follows Planck's law, not classical predictions.
- **Contribution:** Introduced quantum hypothesis (E = nhf), foundation of quantum theory.

These experiments collectively established wave-particle duality, quantum energy levels, and the photon model, revolutionizing our understanding of light-matter interactions and leading to modern quantum physics.

### Question 33: Electromagnetic Induction and Energy (7 marks)

**Analysis of motion and energy transformations:**

**Initial motion:** The magnet swings as a pendulum with mechanical energy (kinetic + gravitational potential energy).

**Electromagnetic induction:** As the magnet swings near the aluminum can, the changing magnetic field induces eddy currents in the conducting aluminum according to Faraday's law (Œµ = -dŒ¶/dt).

**Lenz's law effects:** The induced currents create magnetic fields opposing the change, causing:
1. **Magnetic damping:** The magnet experiences a retarding force, losing mechanical energy
2. **Can rotation:** The interaction between magnet and induced currents causes the can to spin

**Energy transformations:**
- **Magnet:** Mechanical energy ‚Üí Heat (through electromagnetic damping) + rotational kinetic energy of can
- **Can:** Electrical energy (from induced currents) ‚Üí Rotational kinetic energy + Heat (resistive losses)

**Overall system:** Total mechanical energy decreases due to resistive heating in the aluminum can. The system demonstrates electromagnetic braking, where the magnet's pendulum motion gradually dampens while transferring some energy to the can's rotation, with the remainder dissipated as heat through eddy current losses.

**Final state:** Both objects eventually come to rest, with all initial mechanical energy converted to thermal energy through electromagnetic induction processes.
