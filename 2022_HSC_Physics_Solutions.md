## Section I - Multiple Choice Questions (20 marks)

### Question 1 - Transformers
**An ideal transformer has 20 turns on the primary coil and an input voltage of 100 V. How many turns are there on the secondary coil if the output voltage is 400 V?**

**Solution:**
For an ideal transformer: 
$\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \frac{N_s}{N_p}$

Given:
- $V_p = 100 \text{ V}$ (primary voltage)
- $V_s = 400 \text{ V}$ (secondary voltage)  
- $N_p = 20$ turns (primary)
- $N_s = ?$ (secondary)

$\frac{400}{100} = \frac{N_s}{20}$

$4 = \frac{N_s}{20}$

$N_s = 80 \text{ turns}$

**Answer: C. 80**

### Question 2 - Stellar Spectra
**The absorption lines in a star's spectrum are shown. What feature of the star is directly responsible for these absorption lines?**

**Solution:**
Absorption lines in stellar spectra are created when photons of specific wavelengths are absorbed by atoms in the star's atmosphere. Each element has a unique set of absorption lines corresponding to its electron energy levels.

**Answer: D. Chemical composition**

### Question 3 - Radioactive Decay
**A radioisotope emits radiation which is deflected by an electric field. What type of radiation is this?**

**Solution:**
- Alpha particles (α): Positively charged, deflected toward negative plate
- Beta negative (β⁻): Negatively charged electrons, deflected toward positive plate
- Beta positive (β⁺): Positively charged positrons, deflected toward negative plate
- Gamma rays (γ): Neutral electromagnetic radiation, not deflected

Since the radiation is deflected by the electric field, it must be charged. The direction of deflection indicates the charge type.

**Answer: D. Beta negative (electron)** - assuming deflection toward positive plate

### Question 4 - Magnetic Force on Current-Carrying Wire
**A current-carrying wire is in a magnetic field. What is the direction of the force on the wire?**

**Solution:**
Use the right-hand rule for magnetic force: $\vec{F} = I\vec{L} \times \vec{B}$

1. Point fingers in direction of current (I)
2. Curl fingers toward magnetic field direction (B)  
3. Thumb points in direction of force

From the diagram showing current and magnetic field directions, apply the right-hand rule.

**Answer: B. Right** (based on typical setup)

### Question 5 - Quark Composition
**What combination of quarks forms a neutron?**

**Solution:**
Neutron properties:
- Charge = 0
- Made of 3 quarks

Quark charges:
- Up quark: $q_u = +\frac{2}{3}e$
- Down quark: $q_d = -\frac{1}{3}e$

For neutral charge:
$1 \text{ up} + 2 \text{ down} = (+\frac{2}{3}) + 2(-\frac{1}{3}) = +\frac{2}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = 0$

**Answer: B. 1 up, 2 down**

### Question 6 - Orbital Energy
**Which type of energy is greater at position P than at Q in an elliptical orbit?**

**Solution:**
In an elliptical orbit:
- At perihelion (closest point P): higher kinetic energy, lower potential energy
- At aphelion (farthest point Q): lower kinetic energy, higher potential energy
- Total energy remains constant

Position P is closer to the star, so gravitational potential energy is more negative (less potential energy) and kinetic energy is higher.

**Answer: A. Kinetic**

### Question 7 - Photon Energy and Frequency
**A photon has an energy of 9.0 × 10⁻²⁴ J. What is the frequency of this radiation?**

**Solution:**
Use Planck's equation: 
$E = hf$

Given:
- $E = 9.0 \times 10^{-24} \text{ J}$
- $h = 6.63 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}$

$f = \frac{E}{h} = \frac{9.0 \times 10^{-24}}{6.63 \times 10^{-34}}$

$f = 1.36 \times 10^{10} \text{ Hz}$

**Answer: C. 1.36 × 10¹⁰ Hz**

### Question 8 - Projectile Motion Components
**An object is launched with initial velocity u and hits a wall with final velocity v. Which statement correctly compares components of u and v?**

**Solution:**
In projectile motion:
- Horizontal component remains constant (no horizontal acceleration)
- Vertical component changes due to gravity

Since the projectile hits a wall, it has traveled horizontally and vertically. The horizontal component should be the same, but air resistance or the specific trajectory might affect this.

**Answer: A. The vertical component of v is less than the vertical component of u** (due to gravity acting downward)

### Question 9 - Black Body Radiation
**The radiation emitted by a black body has a peak wavelength of 5.8 × 10⁻⁷ m. What is its temperature?**

**Solution:**
Use Wien's displacement law: 
$\lambda_{\text{max}} T = 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m·K}$

Given:
- $\lambda_{\text{max}} = 5.8 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}$

$T = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{\lambda_{\text{max}}} = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{5.8 \times 10^{-7}}$

$T = 5000 \text{ K}$

**Answer: C. 5000 K**

### Question 10 - Orbital Velocity
**The orbital velocity v of a satellite is given by $v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$. Which graph is consistent with this relationship?**

**Solution:**
From the given relationship:
$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$

Squaring both sides:
$v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$

This can be rewritten as:
$v^2 = GM \cdot \frac{1}{r}$

This shows that $v^2$ is inversely proportional to $r$:
$v^2 \propto \frac{1}{r}$

The graph should show $v^2$ decreasing as $r$ increases, following a hyperbolic relationship.

**Answer: D** (showing inverse relationship between v² and r)

### Question 11 - Projectile Motion Graphs
**A projectile is launched vertically upwards. Which velocity-time graph corresponds to this motion?**

**Solution:**
For vertical projectile motion:
- Initial velocity is positive (upward)
- Acceleration is constant and negative (gravity)
- Velocity decreases linearly until zero at maximum height
- Then becomes negative (downward) with same magnitude of acceleration

The v-t graph should be a straight line with negative slope, starting at a positive velocity and becoming negative.

**Answer: A** (linear decrease from positive to negative velocity)

### Question 12 - Charged Particle in Electric and Magnetic Fields
**A positively charged particle moves at constant velocity in uniform electric and magnetic fields. What is the direction of the particle's velocity?**

**Solution:**
For constant velocity, the net force must be zero:
$\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_{\text{electric}} + \vec{F}_{\text{magnetic}} = 0$

$q\vec{E} + q\vec{v} \times \vec{B} = 0$

$\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B} = 0$

$\vec{v} \times \vec{B} = -\vec{E}$

The electric and magnetic forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Given the field orientations shown in the diagram, use the right-hand rule to determine the velocity direction that produces this force balance.

**Answer: D. To the right**

### Question 13 - Satellite Orbits
**Two satellites share an orbit around a planet. One has twice the mass of the other. Which quantity would be different?**

**Solution:**
For circular orbital motion, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force:
$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$

Solving for orbital speed:
$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$

This shows that orbital speed is independent of satellite mass $m$.

For orbital period:
$T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} = 2\pi r \sqrt{\frac{r}{GM}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}}$

Period is also independent of satellite mass.

For centripetal acceleration:
$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{GM}{r^2}$

Acceleration is also independent of satellite mass.

For momentum:
$p = mv$

Since $v$ is the same for both satellites but masses are different:
$p_2 = 2m \cdot v = 2mv = 2p_1$

**Answer: B. Momentum**

### Question 14 - Photoelectric Effect
**Line X shows results of a photoelectric experiment. What change would produce results shown by line Y?**

**Solution:**
The photoelectric equation is:
$E_k = hf - \phi$

where:
- $E_k$ is maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons
- $h$ is Planck's constant
- $f$ is frequency of incident light
- $\phi$ is the work function of the metal

Line Y shows the same slope as line X but shifted downward, indicating:
- Same value of $h$ (same slope)
- Higher threshold frequency (line intercepts x-axis at higher frequency)
- This corresponds to a metal with greater work function $\phi$

**Answer: B. Using a metal that has a greater work function**

### Question 15 - Magnetic Force Between Current-Carrying Wires
**Two wires carry equal currents producing magnetic force. Separation increases to 4d and current doubles. What happens to the force?**

**Solution:**
The magnetic force between two parallel current-carrying wires is:
$F = \frac{\mu_0 I_1 I_2 L}{2\pi d}$

Initial conditions:
- Currents: $I_1 = I_2 = I$
- Separation: $d$
- Force: $F_1 = \frac{\mu_0 I^2 L}{2\pi d}$

Final conditions:
- Currents: $I_1 = I_2 = 2I$
- Separation: $4d$
- Force: $F_2 = \frac{\mu_0 (2I)(2I) L}{2\pi (4d)} = \frac{\mu_0 \cdot 4I^2 L}{2\pi \cdot 4d} = \frac{\mu_0 I^2 L}{2\pi d}$

Therefore: $F_2 = F_1$

**Answer: A. It does not change**

### Question 16 - Nuclear Binding Energy
**He-4 has binding energy 28.3 MeV, Be-6 has binding energy 26.9 MeV. Which statement is correct?**

**Solution:**
Binding energy represents the energy required to separate a nucleus into individual nucleons.

Higher binding energy means:
- More energy required for separation
- More stable nucleus
- Lower mass (due to mass-energy equivalence)

Since He-4 has higher binding energy than Be-6:
- He-4 requires more energy to separate
- He-4 has lower mass than the sum of its separated nucleons
- Be-6 has higher actual mass than He-4 (less binding energy means less mass converted to binding energy)

**Answer: A. He-4 requires more energy to separate into individual protons and neutrons; He-4 is less massive than Be-6**

### Question 17 - Polarized Light
**Unpolarized light passes through vertical filter, then rotating polarized glasses. Which statement about intensity $I_y$ is correct?**

**Solution:**
Using Malus's Law: $I = I_0 \cos^2\theta$

Initial setup:
- Unpolarized light intensity $I_0$ becomes $\frac{I_0}{2}$ after first vertical filter
- This vertically polarized light then encounters the rotating glasses

For the rotating filter at angle $\theta$ to vertical:
$I_y = \frac{I_0}{2} \cos^2\theta$

As the filter rotates through 360°:
- At $\theta = 0°$ (vertical): $I_y = \frac{I_0}{2}$
- At $\theta = 90°$ (horizontal): $I_y = 0$
- At $\theta = 45°$: $I_y = \frac{I_0}{4}$

Since $I_y$ varies continuously from 0 to $\frac{I_0}{2}$, it will sometimes equal other intensities at intermediate positions.

**Answer: C. $I_y$ sometimes equals $I_z$**

### Question 18 - Millikan Oil Drop Experiment
**Oil droplet moves down at constant speed (switch open), then up at same constant speed (switch closed). Which forces relationship is correct?**

**Solution:**
Forces acting on the droplet:
- $F_G$: gravitational force (downward)
- $F_E$: electric force (direction depends on droplet charge and field direction)
- $F_F$: friction force (opposes motion)

**Switch open (downward motion at constant velocity):**
Net force = 0, so: $F_G = F_F$

**Switch closed (upward motion at same constant speed):**
Net force = 0, so: $F_E = F_G + F_F$

Since $F_G = F_F$ from the first condition:
$F_E = F_G + F_G = 2F_G$

But this contradicts the given options. Let me reconsider...

Actually, friction always opposes motion:
- Downward motion: friction acts upward
- Upward motion: friction acts downward

**Switch open:** $F_G = F_F$ (downward motion)
**Switch closed:** $F_E = F_G + F_F$ (upward motion)

**Answer: D. $F_G = F_F$ and $F_E = F_G + F_F$**

### Question 19 - AC Generator Load
**AC generator with one globe (Circuit 1), then two globes in series (Circuit 2). Compare effort to turn handle.**

**Solution:**
When globes are connected in series, the total resistance increases:
$R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 = 2R$

For same generator (same EMF), higher resistance means lower current:
$I_2 = \frac{V}{2R} = \frac{I_1}{2}$

The opposing torque in a generator is proportional to the current:
$\tau \propto I$

Since $I_2 < I_1$, the opposing torque is smaller, making the handle easier to turn.

**Answer: A. The handle in Circuit 2 is easier to turn because the smaller current in Circuit 2 produces less opposing torque**

### Question 20 - Relativistic Length Contraction
**A wheel rolls at 0.4c past observer X. How does the observer describe length contraction at points P, Q, and R?**

**Solution:**
Length contraction depends on the velocity component parallel to the direction of relative motion.

For a rolling wheel with center velocity $v = 0.4c$:
- Point P (bottom of wheel): $v_P = 0$ (instantaneous contact with ground)
- Point Q (center of wheel): $v_Q = 0.4c$
- Point R (top of wheel): $v_R = 0.8c$

Length contraction factor: $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$

- Point P: $v = 0$, so no length contraction
- Point Q: $v = 0.4c$, so some length contraction
- Point R: $v = 0.8c$, so maximum length contraction

**Answer: B. It is zero at P and greatest at R**

**Method: Rotating Mirror Method (Michelson's approach)**

**Procedure:**
1. Set up laser, rotating mirror, fixed mirror, and detector in line
2. Measure distance $d$ between rotating and fixed mirrors
3. Rotate mirror at known frequency $f$
4. Light travels distance $2d$ while mirror rotates through small angle
5. Measure the displacement of reflected beam

- Calculate: $c = \frac{d}{t}$

**Limiting Factor:**
- **Timing precision** - Electronic response time of detectors limits measurement accuracy
- Systematic errors in distance measurement
- Atmospheric refraction affects light speed
- Temperature and pressure variations

### Question 24 (4 marks) - Radioactive Decay

**(a) Find half-life and show decay constant λ = 0.043 h⁻¹ (2 marks)**

**Solution:**
From the graph:
- Initial mass: 80 μg
- Half-life occurs when mass = 40 μg
- Reading from graph: $t_{1/2} = 16$ hours

Using the relationship:
$\lambda = \frac{\ln 2}{t_{1/2}} = \frac{0.693}{16} = 0.043 \text{ h}^{-1}$

**(b) Calculate time for mass to reach 8 μg (2 marks)**

**Solution:**
Using the decay equation:
$N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$

Where:
- $N_0 = 80$ μg
- $N(t) = 8$ μg
- $\lambda = 0.043$ h⁻¹

$8 = 80 e^{-0.043t}$
$\frac{8}{80} = e^{-0.043t}$
$0.1 = e^{-0.043t}$
$\ln(0.1) = -0.043t$
$-2.303 = -0.043t$
$t = \frac{2.303}{0.043} = 53.6 \text{ hours}$

### Question 25 (5 marks) - Rocket Energy Conservation

**(a) Show change in kinetic energy is 2.2 × 10⁹ J (2 marks)**

**Solution:**
$\Delta E_k = \frac{1}{2}m(v_2^2 - v_1^2)$

Given:
- $m = 200$ kg
- $v_1 = 5500$ m/s
- $v_2 = 2900$ m/s

$\Delta E_k = \frac{1}{2} \times 200 \times (2900^2 - 5500^2)$
$\Delta E_k = 100 \times (8.41 \times 10^6 - 3.025 \times 10^7)$
$\Delta E_k = 100 \times (-2.184 \times 10^7)$
$\Delta E_k = -2.184 \times 10^9 \text{ J}$

Magnitude: $|\Delta E_k| = 2.2 \times 10^9$ J ✓

**(b) Determine planet mass M using conservation of energy (3 marks)**

**Solution:**
Using conservation of energy:
$E_1 = E_2$
$\frac{1}{2}mv_1^2 - \frac{GMm}{R_1} = \frac{1}{2}mv_2^2 - \frac{GMm}{R_2}$

Rearranging:
$\frac{1}{2}m(v_1^2 - v_2^2) = GMm\left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right)$

$\frac{1}{2}(v_1^2 - v_2^2) = GM\left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right)$

Substituting values:
$\frac{1}{2}(5500^2 - 2900^2) = GM\left(\frac{1}{4.3 \times 10^6} - \frac{1}{2.5 \times 10^7}\right)$

$\frac{1}{2}(3.025 \times 10^7 - 8.41 \times 10^6) = GM(2.326 \times 10^{-7} - 4.0 \times 10^{-8})$

$1.092 \times 10^7 = GM \times 1.926 \times 10^{-7}$

$M = \frac{1.092 \times 10^7}{G \times 1.926 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{1.092 \times 10^7}{6.67 \times 10^{-11} \times 1.926 \times 10^{-7}}$

$M = 8.5 \times 10^{23} \text{ kg}$

### Question 26 (6 marks) - Photoelectric Effect

**(a) Show maximum kinetic energy of photoelectron is 3.2 × 10⁻²⁰ J (3 marks)**

**Solution:**
Using the photoelectric equation:
$E_k = hf - \phi$

Given:
- $f = 7.5 \times 10^{14}$ Hz
- $\phi = 2.9$ eV $= 2.9 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} = 4.64 \times 10^{-19}$ J
- $h = 6.63 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s

$E_k = (6.63 \times 10^{-34})(7.5 \times 10^{14}) - 4.64 \times 10^{-19}$
$E_k = 4.97 \times 10^{-19} - 4.64 \times 10^{-19}$
$E_k = 3.3 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J}$

(Within rounding: $3.2 \times 10^{-20}$ J) ✓

**(b) Calculate maximum distance d photoelectron can travel (3 marks)**

**Solution:**
The photoelectron will decelerate in the electric field until all kinetic energy is converted to potential energy:

$E_k = qEd$

Where:
- $q = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C (electron charge magnitude)
- $E = 5.2$ N/C
- $E_k = 3.2 \times 10^{-20}$ J

$d = \frac{E_k}{qE} = \frac{3.2 \times 10^{-20}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \times 5.2}$

$d = \frac{3.2 \times 10^{-20}}{8.32 \times 10^{-19}} = 3.8 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}$

$d = 3.8 \text{ cm}$

## Question 27 (7 marks) - Double Slit Experiment

### Given:
- Red light wavelength: λ = 655 nm = 655 × 10⁻⁹ m
- Slit separation: d = 5.0 × 10⁻⁵ m

### Part (a) - Newton's Model (2 marks)

**Newton's particle model would predict:**

```
Screen pattern for Newton's model:

    |     |     |
    |     |     |
    |     |     |
    |     |     |
    |     |     |
    
Centre of screen
```

Newton's model would show two bright lines corresponding to light particles passing through each slit, with no interference pattern.

### Part (b) - Calculate angle θ (3 marks)

For the first bright fringe (m = 1):
```
dsinθ = mλ
sinθ = mλ/d
sinθ = (1 × 655 × 10⁻⁹)/(5.0 × 10⁻⁵)
sinθ = 1.31 × 10⁻²
θ = sin⁻¹(1.31 × 10⁻²)
θ = 0.75°
```

### Part (c) - Green light wavelength 520 nm (2 marks)

**Answer:** The pattern would be more tightly spaced (fringes closer together).

**Explanation:** Since λ_green < λ_red, and the fringe spacing is proportional to wavelength (from dsinθ = mλ), the green light will produce smaller angles θ for each bright fringe, resulting in fringes that are closer to the center line.

## Question 28 (3 marks) - CNO Cycle Nuclear Fusion

### Given:
- Step X: ¹³N → ¹³C + e⁺ + ν, releases 1.20 MeV
- Step Y: ¹³C + ¹H → ¹⁴N

### Mass data:
- Carbon-13: 13.003 u
- Proton: 1.007 u  
- Nitrogen-14: 14.003 u

### Solution:

**Calculate Q-value for Step Y:**
```
Q = (mass of reactants - mass of products) × 931.5 MeV/u
Q = (13.003 + 1.007 - 14.003) × 931.5
Q = 0.007 × 931.5 = 6.52 MeV
```

**Reason:** Step Y releases more energy (6.52 MeV) than Step X (1.20 MeV) because Step Y involves nuclear fusion, where two lighter nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus. The mass defect in fusion reactions is typically larger than in decay processes, resulting in greater energy release according to E = mc².

## Question 29 (4 marks) - Projectile Motion from Moving Car

### Scenario:
Apple thrown horizontally east from car moving north with uniform velocity.

### Solution:

**Horizontal Components:**
- **East direction:** Apple maintains constant velocity equal to its initial throwing velocity (no horizontal forces acting)
- **North direction:** Apple maintains constant velocity equal to the car's velocity due to inertia (Newton's First Law)

**Vertical Component:**
- Apple experiences constant downward acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.8 m/s²)
- Initial vertical velocity is zero
- Vertical motion follows kinematic equations: v = gt, s = ½gt²

**Summary:** The apple follows a parabolic path when viewed from the ground, with constant horizontal velocity components in both east and north directions, and uniformly accelerated motion in the vertical direction.

## Question 30 (6 marks) - Special Relativity and Time Dilation

### Part (a) - Einstein's Thought Experiment (3 marks)

**Answer:** 

Einstein's thought experiment demonstrates that:

1. **Constancy of speed of light:** Light travels at the same speed c for all observers, regardless of their reference frame.

2. **Different path lengths:** The observer outside the train sees light travel a longer diagonal path, while the observer inside sees light travel a shorter vertical path.

3. **Time dilation prediction:** Since distance = speed × time, and the speed of light is constant for both observers, but the distances are different, the time intervals must be different. The outside observer measures a longer time interval, leading to the prediction that time runs slower for the moving observer (time dilation).

### Part (b) - Calculation (3 marks)

**Given:**
- v = 0.96c
- Proper time (inside train): t₀ = 15 ns

**Calculate time dilation factor:**
```
γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²)
γ = 1/√(1 - (0.96)²)
γ = 1/√(1 - 0.9216)
γ = 1/√0.0784
γ = 1/0.28 = 3.57
```

**Time measured by outside observer:**
```
t = γt₀
t = 3.57 × 15 ns
t = 53.6 ns
```

## Question 31 (9 marks) - Atomic Models and Hydrogen Spectrum

### Experimental Evidence:
1. **Geiger-Marsden:** Most α-particles pass through, few deflect at large angles
2. **Hydrogen spectrum:** Discrete spectral lines in Balmer series

### Bohr-Rutherford Model Features:

**1. Nuclear Structure (Geiger-Marsden Results):**
- Atom has small, dense, positively charged nucleus
- Most of atom is empty space (explains why most α-particles pass through)
- Large angle deflections occur when α-particles approach nucleus closely

**2. Quantized Energy Levels (Hydrogen Spectrum):**
- Electrons orbit nucleus in discrete energy levels: E_n = -13.6/n² eV
- Energy transitions between levels produce photons with specific frequencies
- Balmer series: transitions from n≥3 to n=2

### Sample Calculation:
**Balmer series n=3 to n=2 transition:**

## Question 32 (6 marks) - Electromagnetic Induction in Exercise Bike

### Part (a) - Principle (3 marks)

**Answer:**

When the aluminum flywheel rotates through the magnetic field:

1. **Induced EMF:** The rotating flywheel cuts through magnetic field lines, inducing an EMF (Faraday's Law: ε = -dΦ/dt)

2. **Eddy Currents:** The induced EMF drives circular currents (eddy currents) within the aluminum flywheel

3. **Opposing Force:** These eddy currents create their own magnetic field that opposes the motion (Lenz's Law), generating a torque that resists the rotation and makes pedaling harder

### Part (b) - Increasing Opposing Torque (3 marks)

**Adjustment:** Move the magnets closer to the flywheel.

**Justification:**
- Closer magnets create stronger magnetic field through the flywheel
- Stronger magnetic field → larger induced EMF (ε ∝ B)
- Larger EMF → larger eddy currents (I ∝ ε)
- Larger currents → stronger opposing magnetic force and greater resistive torque (F ∝ I, τ ∝ F)

## Question 33 (6 marks) - Projectile Motion in Hammer Throw

### Given:
- Mass: m = 7.0 kg
- Radius: r = 1.6 m
- Period: T = 0.50 s
- Release height: h = 1.2 m
- Release angle: 45° to horizontal

### Part (a) - Vertical Component of Velocity (2 marks)

**Calculate tangential velocity:**
```
v = 2πr/T = 2π × 1.6/0.50 = 20.1 m/s
```

**Vertical component at 45°:**
```
v_y = v sin(45°) = 20.1 × sin(45°)
v_y = 20.1 × 0.707 = 14.2 m/s
```

### Part (b) - Horizontal Range (4 marks)

**Given:**
- v_x = v cos(45°) = 20.1 × 0.707 = 14.2 m/s
- v_y = 14.2 m/s (upward)
- h = 1.2 m

**Find time of flight:**
Using: s = ut + ½at²
```
-1.2 = 14.2t - ½(9.8)t²
4.9t² - 14.2t - 1.2 = 0
```

Using quadratic formula:
```
t = (14.2 ± √(14.2² + 4×4.9×1.2))/(2×4.9)
t = (14.2 ± √(201.64 + 23.52))/9.8
t = (14.2 ± 15.0)/9.8
t = 2.98 s (taking positive value)
```

**Horizontal range:**
```
R = v_x × t = 14.2 × 2.98 = 42.3 m
```

## Question 34 (7 marks) - Charged Particles in Magnetic Field

### Analysis of Particle Paths:

**Magnetic Force on Moving Charges:**
F = qvB (perpendicular to both v and B)

**Path Analysis:**

**Particle X:** Curves upward (concave up)
- Positively charged (q > 0)
- Magnetic force provides centripetal force toward center of curvature
- Radius: r = mv/(qB)

**Particle Y:** Travels straight
- Neutral charge (q = 0)
- No magnetic force acting (F = qvB = 0)
- Continues in straight line (Newton's First Law)

**Particle Z:** Curves downward (concave down)  
- Negatively charged (q < 0)
- Magnetic force acts in opposite direction to particle X
- Same radius magnitude as X if |q| and m are equal

**Key Physics:**
- Direction of curvature depends on sign of charge
- Radius of curvature depends on charge magnitude, mass, and speed
- Neutral particles are unaffected by magnetic fields

## Question 35 (5 marks) - Orbital Motion Analysis

### Given:
- Capsule mass: m₁ = 1.2 × 10⁴ kg
- ISS mass: m₂ = 4.2 × 10⁵ kg  
- Orbital velocity: v = 0.233 m/s
- Orbital radius: r = 200 m

### Hypothesis Testing:

**Calculate required centripetal force:**
```
F_c = m₁v²/r = (1.2 × 10⁴ × (0.233)²)/200
F_c = (1.2 × 10⁴ × 0.0543)/200 = 3.26 N
```

**Calculate gravitational force:**
```
F_g = Gm₁m₂/r²
F_g = (6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ × 1.2 × 10⁴ × 4.2 × 10⁵)/(200)²
F_g = (3.36 × 10⁻¹)/40000 = 8.4 × 10⁻⁶ N
```

**Analysis:**
- Required centripetal force: 3.26 N
- Available gravitational force: 8.4 × 10⁻⁶ N
- Gravitational force is approximately 400,000 times smaller than required

**Conclusion:**
The hypothesis is **rejected**. The gravitational force between the capsule and ISS is far too small to provide the necessary centripetal force for circular motion. The actual circular motion is maintained by other forces, likely mechanical connections or the ISS's own orbital motion around Earth.
