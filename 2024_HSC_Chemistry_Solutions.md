# 2024 HSC Chemistry - Complete Worked Solutions

## Section I - Multiple Choice Questions (20 marks)

### Question 1
**Which two substances are members of the same homologous series?**

**Answer: A**

**Solution:** A homologous series consists of compounds with the same functional group and general formula, differing by CH₂ units. Looking at the options:
- Option A shows two alcohols (both have -OH functional group)
- Option B shows an alcohol and an ether
- Option C shows an alcohol and a haloalkane  
- Option D shows different functional groups

Only option A contains two members of the same homologous series (alcohols).

### Question 2
**Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have used leaching in flowing water over several days to prepare various foods from plants that can be toxic to humans. What was the reason for this?**

**Answer: B**

**Solution:** Leaching with flowing water removes water-soluble toxins by dissolving them and carrying them away. This process specifically targets toxins with low solubility that can gradually dissolve over time with continuous water flow.

### Question 3
**Which of the following compounds can be correctly described as an Arrhenius base when dissolved in water?**

**Answer: D**

**Solution:** An Arrhenius base produces OH⁻ ions when dissolved in water. 
- Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) → Na⁺ + OH⁻
- The other options are salts that don't produce OH⁻ ions directly

### Question 4 [ Need to check - A ] 
**An infrared spectrum of an organic compound is shown. Which compound would produce this spectrum?**

**Answer: B**

**Solution:** The IR spectrum shows:
- Broad peak around 3000-3500 cm⁻¹: O-H stretch (carboxylic acid)
- Peak around 1700 cm⁻¹: C=O stretch
- This pattern is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (COOH group)

### Question 5
**Which would be the best reagent to determine whether an unknown substance was 2-methylpropan-1-ol or 2-methylpropan-2-ol?**

**Answer: D**

**Solution:** 
- 2-methylpropan-1-ol is a primary alcohol
- 2-methylpropan-2-ol is a tertiary alcohol
- Acidified potassium permanganate will oxidize primary alcohols but not tertiary alcohols
- This difference in reactivity allows distinction between the two

### Question 6
**What is the hydroxide ion concentration of a solution of potassium hydroxide with a pH of 11?**

**Answer: B**

**Solution:**
- pH = 11, so pOH = 14 - 11 = 3
- [OH⁻] = 10⁻ᵖᴼᴴ = 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹

### Question 7
**The equilibrium: 2SO₂(g) + O₂(g) ⇌ 2SO₃(g) ΔH = -198 kJ mol⁻¹. Which would increase the yield of SO₃(g)?**

**Answer: C**

**Solution:** Using Le Chatelier's principle:
- Removing product shifts equilibrium forward (increases yield)
- Increasing volume favors the side with more gas molecules (reactants)
- Increasing temperature favors endothermic direction (reverse reaction)
- Option C is correct

### Question 8
**Which pair of ions produce different colours in a flame test?**

**Answer: C**

**Solution:**
- Cu²⁺ produces a blue-green flame
- Ca²⁺ produces an orange-red flame
- These are distinctly different colors, while the other pairs don't produce characteristic flame colors or produce similar colors

### Question 9 [correct: B]
**Which is the mass spectrum of ethanamine?**

**Answer: A**

**Solution:** Ethanamine (C₂H₅NH₂) has molecular mass = 45
- Molecular ion peak at m/z = 45
- Common fragmentation: loss of NH₂ (16) gives m/z = 29
- Base peak typically at m/z = 30 ([CH₂=NH₂]⁺)

### Question 10
**A catalyst is added to the equilibrium system. Which row correctly identifies the change in yield of propan-2-one and reaction rates?**

**Answer: B**

**Solution:** A catalyst:
- Increases both forward and reverse reaction rates equally
- Does not change the equilibrium position (yield remains the same)
- Only affects the rate at which equilibrium is reached

### Question 11
**Which is the correct expression for calculating the solubility of lead(II) iodide in a 0.1 mol L⁻¹ solution of NaI at 25°C?**

**Answer: D**

**Solution:** 
PbI₂ ⇌ Pb²⁺ + 2I⁻
- Ksp = [Pb²⁺][I⁻]²
- [I⁻] = 0.1 + 2s ≈ 0.1 (common ion effect)
- 9.8 × 10⁻⁹ = s × (0.1)²
- s = 9.8 × 10⁻⁹ / (0.1)²

### Question 12
**What is the preferred IUPAC name for this substance?**

**Answer: C**

**Solution:** The structure shows:
- A butanamide (4-carbon chain with amide group)
- Chlorine on carbon 3
- Ethyl group on nitrogen
- Name: 3-chloro-N-ethylbutanamide

### Question 13
**A fuel has enthalpies of combustion: -2057.8 kJ mol⁻¹ and -48.9 kJ g⁻¹. Which fuel is it?**

**Answer: C**

**Solution:**
- Molar mass = 2057.8 ÷ 48.9 = 42.1 g mol⁻¹
- This matches propene (C₃H₆ = 42.1 g mol⁻¹)

### Question 14
**Which monomer could react with glycine to form this section of silk polymer?**

**Answer: B**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/176da117-32ff-43e1-b908-743d001cdcee)


**Solution:** The polymer shows alternating residues with CH₃ side chains. The monomer needed is alanine (H₂N-CH(CH₃)-COOH) to provide the CH₃ groups shown in the polymer structure.

### Question 15
**What is the ratio of [O₂(g)] in container P to [O₂(g)] in container Q?**

**Answer: A**

**Solution:** 
2Li₂O₂(s) ⇌ 2Li₂O(s) + O₂(g)
- O₂ pressure depends only on temperature (constant)
- The amount of solid doesn't affect gas pressure at equilibrium
- Ratio = 1:1

### Question 16
**Which is the overall reaction when strong acid is added to an acetate buffer?**

**Answer: C**

**Solution:** In an acetate buffer, the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) reacts with added H₃O⁺:
CH₃COO⁻ + H₃O⁺ → CH₃COOH + H₂O

### Question 17
**Which acid was used in the titration based on the pH curve?**

**Answer: C**

**Solution:** The curve shows:
- Two equivalence points (diprotic acid)
- First equivalence point around pH 4
- Second equivalence point around pH 9
- This matches acid 3 with pKa1 = 1.91 and pKa2 = 6.30

### Question 18
**Which diagram shows how Q changes over time for this mixture?**

**Answer: B**

**Solution:** 
- Initially, forward rate > reverse rate, so reaction proceeds forward
- Q starts below K and increases toward K
- Q approaches K asymptotically from below

### Question 19
**Which compound produces TWO doublets in ¹H NMR?**

**Answer: A**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2da358b0-0b8d-46b0-bba8-f87f6a77362a)


**Solution:** For two doublets, you need two different CH₃ groups each coupled to one proton:
- Structure A has CH₃CH₂- pattern
- The CH₃ appears as a doublet (coupled to CH₂)
- The CH₂ appears as a quartet, but if there's symmetry, could appear as doublet

### Question 20 [D]
**What is the concentration of ascorbic acid in solution A?**

**Answer: A**

**Solution:**
- Additional ascorbic acid: 50.00 mg = 0.05000 g
- Moles added: 0.05000 ÷ 176.124 = 2.840 × 10⁻⁴ mol
- Additional titre: 33.10 - 17.50 = 15.60 mL
- Concentration = (2.840 × 10⁻⁴ mol) ÷ (0.025 L) = 0.01136 mol L⁻¹
- Original concentration = (17.50/15.60) × 0.01136 = 5.352 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹

## Section II - Extended Response Questions (80 marks)

### Question 21 (2 marks)
**Products of acetic acid + magnesium reaction:**

**Answer:** 
- Magnesium acetate (or magnesium ethanoate)
- Hydrogen gas

**Equation:** 2CH₃COOH + Mg → Mg(CH₃COO)₂ + H₂

### Question 22 (2 marks)
**Six-carbon section of poly(vinyl fluoride):**

**Structure:**
```
-CF₂-CH₂-CF₂-CH₂-CF₂-CH₂-
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/544f239b-7763-450e-adc5-715131611366)

The polymer forms by addition polymerization, with alternating CF₂ and CH₂ groups.

### Question 23 (3 marks)
**Relate the color change to the change in Keq:**

When heated, the solution becomes more blue, indicating the equilibrium shifts right toward [CoCl₄]²⁻. This means Keq increases with temperature. Since the forward reaction produces more blue color, it must be endothermic (ΔH > 0). According to van't Hoff's equation, for an endothermic reaction, increasing temperature increases Keq.

### Question 24 (7 marks)
**(a) Graph:** Plot boiling points vs number of carbon atoms
- Amines: lower boiling points, increasing trend
- Alcohols: higher boiling points, steeper increasing trend
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52cdede3-84a8-4046-85c5-aba9508c8102)



**(b) Explanation:**
Within each series, boiling points increase with molecular size due to stronger dispersion forces from increased molecular surface area.

Between series, alcohols have higher boiling points than amines because:
- Both can form hydrogen bonds
- O-H bonds in alcohols are more polar than N-H bonds in amines
- Oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen
- This creates stronger hydrogen bonding in alcohols

### Question 25 (4 marks)
**Determine phosphate ion concentration:**

From the calibration graph:
- Absorbance = 0.64
- Concentration in diluted solution ≈ 0.80 mg L⁻¹
- Original concentration = 0.80 × 1000 = 800 mg L⁻¹
- Convert to mol L⁻¹: 800 mg L⁻¹ ÷ 94.97 g mol⁻¹ = 0.0084 mol L⁻¹

### Question 26 (5 marks)
**(a) Graph:** [I₂] starts at 2.0 × 10⁻⁵, decreases to 1.0 × 10⁻⁵ at 3 min, then remains constant.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ee3c81e-b272-4302-974d-8c740b8b768b)


**(b) Collision theory explanation:**
Initially (0-3 min): High [I₂] means frequent collisions between I₂ and HCN molecules, leading to fast reaction rate.
After 3 min: [I₂] is lower and constant at equilibrium. Forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, so [I₂] remains constant.

### Question 27 (4 marks)
**Explain the procedure limitations:**

The procedure works for barium alone because BaSO₄ precipitates first and Ba²⁺ is completely removed.

When both ions are present, both BaSO₄ and PbSO₄ can precipitate:
Ba²⁺ + SO₄²⁻ → BaSO₄(s)

If lead ions are also present and some PbSO₄ forms, the subsequent bromide test may give false results because lead could still be present in the precipitate rather than the filtrate.

### Question 28 (3 marks)
**Show neither acid dissociates completely:**

For complete dissociation: [H⁺] = initial acid concentration
- Iodic acid: [H⁺] = 10⁻¹·¹⁵¹ = 0.0707 mol L⁻¹ < 0.100 mol L⁻¹
- Sulfamic acid: [H⁺] = 10⁻¹·¹⁵¹ = 0.0707 mol L⁻¹ < 0.120 mol L⁻¹

Neither dissociates completely.

Iodic acid is stronger because it produces the same [H⁺] from a lower initial concentration (0.100 vs 0.120 mol L⁻¹).

### Question 29 (4 marks)
**Calculate pH of resulting solution:**

Moles NaOH: 0.150 L × 0.20 mol L⁻¹ = 0.030 mol
Moles H₂SO₄: 0.100 L × 0.10 mol L⁻¹ = 0.010 mol
Moles H⁺: 0.010 mol × 2 = 0.020 mol

Net moles OH⁻: 0.030 - 0.020 = 0.010 mol
[OH⁻] = 0.010 mol ÷ 0.250 L = 0.040 mol L⁻¹
pOH = -log(0.040) = 1.40
pH = 14.00 - 1.40 = 12.60

### Question 30 (4 marks)
**Calculate unknown amount of CO added:**

Initial Q = [H₂O][CO]/([H₂][CO₂]) = (0.400)(2.000)/((1.000)(0.500)) = 1.600 = Keq

After equilibrium: [H₂O] = 0.200 mol L⁻¹
Change in [H₂O] = 0.200 - 0.400 = -0.200 mol L⁻¹

Using stoichiometry:
Δ[H₂] = +0.200, Δ[CO₂] = +0.200, Δ[CO] = -0.200

Final concentrations:
[H₂] = 1.200, [CO₂] = 0.700, [CO] = x - 0.200

At equilibrium: (0.200)(x - 0.200)/((1.200)(0.700)) = 1.600
Solving: x = 8.920 mol

Amount added = 8.920 - 2.000 = 6.920 mol

### Question 31 (3 marks)
**Which process is preferable:**

The DMC process is preferable because:
1. Higher atom economy (48.4% vs 35.9%) means less waste
2. Lower toxicity reagents (DMC vs phosgene)
3. More environmentally sustainable
4. Better economic efficiency due to reduced waste disposal costs

### Question 32 (4 marks)  [?? Need to validate answer]
**Calculate cadmium ion concentration:**

Cd₃(PO₄)₂ ⇌ 3Cd²⁺ + 2PO₄³⁻

Ksp = [Cd²⁺]³[PO₄³⁻]² = 2.53 × 10⁻³³

Let s = solubility in mol L⁻¹
[Cd²⁺] = 3s, [PO₄³⁻] = 2s

2.53 × 10⁻³³ = (3s)³(2s)² = 108s⁵

s⁵ = 2.34 × 10⁻³⁵
s = 6.33 × 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹

[Cd²⁺] = 3s = 1.90 × 10⁻⁷ mol L⁻¹

### Question 33 (5 marks)
**(a) Molecular shapes:**
- Acetone: Trigonal planar around central carbon
- Product (propan-2-ol): Tetrahedral around central carbon

**(b) ¹³C NMR monitoring:**
The reaction progress can be monitored by observing:
- Disappearance of the carbonyl carbon signal (~200 ppm) from acetone
- Appearance of the alcohol carbon signal (~65 ppm) in the product
- The ratio of these signals indicates the extent of reaction

### Question 34 (4 marks)
**Explain the conductivity graph:**

Initial decrease: NH₃ + HCl → NH₄Cl
High-conductivity H⁺ ions are replaced by lower-conductivity NH₄⁺ ions.

After equivalence point: Excess NH₃ → NH₃ + H₂O ⇌ NH₄⁺ + OH⁻
Additional OH⁻ ions increase conductivity.

**Equations:**
1. NH₃(aq) + HCl(aq) → NH₄Cl(aq)
2. NH₃(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ NH₄⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)

### Question 35 (7 marks)
**Identify the carboxylic acids:**

Analysis of data:
- Y and Z react with Br₂ (unsaturated), X doesn't (saturated)
- 0.100g Y reacts with same Br₂ as 0.200g Z → Y has twice the unsaturation per gram
- Titration data shows Y and Z have same equivalent weight, X is different

**Assignments:**
- X = Structure 3 (144.124 g mol⁻¹, saturated)
- Y = Structure 1 (72.062 g mol⁻¹, alkene)
- Z = Structure 2 (74.078 g mol⁻¹, alkene)

Y has two possible hydration products (Markovnikov/anti-Markovnikov), Z has only one due to symmetry.

### Question 36 (5 marks)
**Calculate enthalpy of reaction:**

Moles NaHCO₃: 14.7 g ÷ 84.008 g mol⁻¹ = 0.175 mol
Mass of solution: 14.7 g + (120 mL × 1.02 g mL⁻¹) = 137.1 g
ΔT = 11.5 - 21.5 = -10.0°C

q = mcΔT = 137.1 g × 3.80 J K⁻¹ g⁻¹ × (-10.0 K) = -5211 J

ΔH = q/n = -5211 J ÷ 0.175 mol = -29.8 kJ mol⁻¹

### Question 37 (3 marks)
**Explain why reaction proceeds to completion:**

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS° = -217 - (-3) = -214 kJ mol⁻¹

From the graph, ΔG° = -214 kJ mol⁻¹ corresponds to Keq >> 10⁶

Such a large equilibrium constant means the reaction essentially goes to completion rather than establishing a significant equilibrium with reactants present.

### Question 38 (7 marks)
**Identify compounds A, B, and E:**

From mass spectrum: M⁺ = 78 (C₃H₇Br)
- Two isomers possible: 1-bromopropane and 2-bromopropane

From oxidation patterns:
- D → ketone (secondary alcohol)
- C → no ketone (primary alcohol)

Therefore:
- A = 2-bromopropane (gives secondary alcohol D)
- B = 1-bromopropane (gives primary alcohol C)

From NMR data of E (ester):
- Integration pattern suggests 3-methylbutanoic acid + ethanol
- E = ethyl 3-methylbutanoate

**Structures:**
- A: (CH₃)₂CHBr
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfa700d3-2e46-4716-80e2-89506c7e8213)

  
- B: CH₃CH₂CH₂Br
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38b8013d-247d-4e0b-8a6f-da35fc8525a5)

  
- E: (CH₃)₂CHCH₂COOCH₂CH₃
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3d453f4-3812-4475-9a01-54a525feab93)


### Question 39 (4 marks)
**Calculate equilibrium concentrations:**

Initial: [BrCH₂COOH] = 0.1000 mol L⁻¹
At equilibrium: [H⁺] = 9.18 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹

Using Ka expression:
Ka = [H⁺][BrCH₂COO⁻]/[BrCH₂COOH(aq)]
1.29 × 10⁻³ = (9.18 × 10⁻³)²/[BrCH₂COOH(aq)]

[BrCH₂COOH(aq)] = (9.18 × 10⁻³)²/(1.29 × 10⁻³) = 0.0653 mol L⁻¹

Mass balance: [BrCH₂COOH(oct)] = 0.1000 - 0.0653 - 9.18 × 10⁻³ = 0.0257 mol L⁻¹

Keq = [BrCH₂COOH(oct)]/[BrCH₂COOH(aq)] = 0.0257/0.0653 = 0.393
