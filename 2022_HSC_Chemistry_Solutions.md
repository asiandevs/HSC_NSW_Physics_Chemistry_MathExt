## Section I - Multiple Choice Questions (1-20)

### Question 1
**What term is used to define the repeating unit of a polymer?**

**Answer: C. Monomer**

A monomer is the basic structural unit that repeats to form a polymer chain. Dimers are two units, isomers are compounds with same molecular formula but different structures, and primers are starting molecules for replication.

### Question 2
**When a solution of a primary standard is prepared for titration, which of the following is required?**

**Answer: B. A balance**

A primary standard must be weighed accurately to determine its exact mass, requiring a balance. The burette, indicator, and condenser are used during the titration process itself.

### Question 3
**Which of the following features is NOT a characteristic of a state of equilibrium?**

**Answer: D. Equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products are equal**

At equilibrium, the rates of forward and reverse reactions are equal, but the concentrations of reactants and products are not necessarily equal. They depend on the equilibrium constant.

### Question 4 [ Need to verify C]
**Which lamp should be used to determine the manganese concentration in the sample?**

**Answer: A**

For atomic absorption spectroscopy, the lamp must emit light at the same wavelengths that the analyte (manganese) absorbs. Lamp A shows emission lines that match the manganese absorption lines.

### Question 5
**Which pair of ions can be distinguished using a flame test in the school laboratory?**

**Answer: B. Ba²⁺ and Ca²⁺**

- Ba²⁺ produces a green flame
- Ca²⁺ produces an orange-red flame
These are easily distinguishable colors in flame tests.

### Question 6
**Which wavelength would be appropriate to determine the concentration of Q in a mixture of the two solutions?**

**Answer: D. 630 nm**

At 630 nm, solution Q shows maximum absorbance while solution P shows minimal absorbance. This wavelength provides the best selectivity for measuring Q without interference from P.

### Question 7
**What is the systematic name of 2-ethyl-3-chlorohexane?**

**Answer: B. 4-chloro-3-methylheptane**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1c9e199-2b82-4747-bfd8-2c78db4ad2bf)


The longest carbon chain has 7 carbons (heptane), with a methyl group at position 3 and chlorine at position 4 when numbered to give substituents the lowest possible numbers.

### Question 8
**What is the equilibrium expression for the system: 2NaHCO₃(s) ⇌ Na₂CO₃(s) + CO₂(g) + H₂O(g)?**

**Answer: B. K_eq = [CO₂][H₂O]**

For heterogeneous equilibria, only gases and aqueous species are included in the equilibrium expression. Solid phases are omitted.

### Question 9
**What is the structure of CH₃C(CH₃)₂CH₂CH(CH₃)₂?**

**Answer: A**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d2a92e4-1e44-4c0d-b51b-d06c129fbf4c)


Breaking down the structure:
- CH₃ (methyl group)
- C(CH₃)₂ (carbon with two methyl branches)
- CH₂ (methylene group)
- CH(CH₃)₂ (carbon with two methyl branches)

### Question 10 [ Need to check C ]
**Which equation shows the hydrogen carbonate ion acting as a Brønsted-Lowry acid?**

**Answer: A. HCO₃⁻(aq) ⇌ CO₃²⁻(aq) + H⁺(aq)**

A Brønsted-Lowry acid donates a proton (H⁺). In this equation, HCO₃⁻ donates H⁺ to form CO₃²⁻.

### Question 11  [ Need to check B ]
**What is the major organic product of cyclohexanol dehydration with concentrated H₂SO₄?**

**Answer: A. Cyclohexene**

Dehydration of alcohols removes water (H₂O) to form alkenes. Cyclohexanol loses water to form cyclohexene (the cyclic alkene).

### Question 12
**Which isomer of C₆H₁₄ would have the fewest signals in ¹³C NMR?**

**Answer: D**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12336527-1f1a-4bac-a0b4-5d2cd1a04605)

The compound with the highest symmetry will have the fewest unique carbon environments. Structure D (2,2-dimethylbutane) has the most symmetrical arrangement.

### Question 13
**2NOBr(g) ⇌ 2NO(g) + Br₂(g)**
**Initial: 0.64 mol NOBr, Equilibrium: 0.46 mol NOBr in 1.00 L flask**

**Answer: A. [NO] = 0.18 mol L⁻¹, [Br₂] = 0.09 mol L⁻¹**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbc14146-3703-4230-a861-a60898ef07b5)

**Calculation:**
- NOBr consumed = 0.64 - 0.46 = 0.18 mol
- From stoichiometry: 2 NOBr → 2 NO + 1 Br₂
- NO formed = 0.18 mol, [NO] = 0.18 mol L⁻¹
- Br₂ formed = 0.09 mol, [Br₂] = 0.09 mol L⁻¹

### Question 14
**2NO₂(g) ⇌ N₂O₄(g), K_eq = 0.010**
**Volume reduced from 100.0 cm³ to 50.0 cm³**

**Answer: B. The ratio [NO₂]²/[N₂O₄] has decreased**

When volume decreases, pressure increases. Le Chatelier's principle predicts the equilibrium shifts toward fewer gas molecules (right side), increasing [N₂O₄] and decreasing the ratio.

### Question 15
**Titration of 25.00 mL of 0.1131 mol L⁻¹ HCl with NH₃ solution**

**Answer: C. 0.283 mol L⁻¹**

**Calculation:**
From the conductivity graph, equivalence point occurs at ~10.0 mL NH₃
- Moles HCl = 0.02500 L × 0.1131 mol L⁻¹ = 0.002828 mol
- Moles NH₃ = moles HCl = 0.002828 mol
- [NH₃] = 0.002828 mol ÷ 0.0100 L = 0.283 mol L⁻¹

### Question 16
**Copper(II) sulfate colourimetry with orange light (λ = 630 nm), pathlength = 1.00 cm**

**Answer: D. Setting the pathlength to 2.00 cm**

From Beer's Law: A = εcl
Doubling the pathlength (l) doubles the absorbance, assuming the same concentration and molar absorptivity.

### Question 17
**Silver carbonate solubility problem**

**Answer: A. 1:1**

**Calculation:**
- Initial amount Ag₂CO₃ = 2.0 g ÷ 275.81 g mol⁻¹ = 0.00725 mol
- Maximum solubility in 100 mL = 1.2 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹ × 0.100 L = 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ mol
- Since 0.00725 mol >> 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ mol, solution is saturated
- After dilution, still saturated, so [Ag⁺] remains constant
- Ratio = 1:1

### Question 18 [Need to check D]
**Biopolymer with molecular weight 2900 ± 100 g mol⁻¹**

**Answer: C**

**Calculation:**
- Option C: 90.078 g mol⁻¹ × 32 units = 2882.5 g mol⁻¹
- This falls within the range 2800-3000 g mol⁻¹

### Question 19 [ Need to check A] 
**Molar solubility of iron(II) hydroxide**

**Answer: C. 3.7 × 10⁻⁶ mol L⁻¹**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4ea7d5c-2e28-444a-8c1c-8f3ea6e1c41c)

**Calculation:**
Fe(OH)₂(s) ⇌ Fe²⁺(aq) + 2OH⁻(aq)
- K_sp = [Fe²⁺][OH⁻]² = 4.9 × 10⁻¹⁷ (from data sheet)
- Let s = molar solubility
- K_sp = (s)(2s)² = 4s³
- s³ = K_sp/4 = 4.9 × 10⁻¹⁷/4 = 1.225 × 10⁻¹⁷
- s = 3.7 × 10⁻⁶ mol L⁻¹

### Question 20
**Cyanidin indicator with 0.75 mol L⁻¹ HIO (pKₐ = 10.64)**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3cd1006-2c5a-4565-9031-364d7bddce76)

**Answer: C. Purple**

**Calculation:**
- pH = ½(pKₐ - log c) = ½(10.64 - log 0.75) = ½(10.64 + 0.125) = 5.38
- From the graph, at pH ~5.4, HCy⁻ (purple) is the dominant species

## Section II - Extended Response Questions (21-36)

### Question 21 (2 marks)
**Draw the structural formula of the product when prop-1-ene reacts with Cl₂**

**Answer:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c64a12d5-b458-43bc-925f-40bf68ef183c)



The addition reaction adds Cl₂ across the double bond to form 1,2-dichloropropane.

### Question 22 (2 marks)
**HF(aq) + PO₄³⁻(aq) ⇌ HPO₄²⁻(aq) + F⁻(aq)**

**Answer:**
| Base | Conjugate Acid |
|------|----------------|
| PO₄³⁻ | HPO₄²⁻ |

PO₄³⁻ accepts a proton to form HPO₄²⁻, making it a Brønsted-Lowry base and its conjugate acid.

### Question 23 (6 marks)
**4NH₃(g) + 5O₂(g) ⇌ 4NO(g) + 6H₂O(g) ΔH = -950 kJ mol⁻¹**

**(a) Effect of increasing temperature on NO(g) amount (1 mark)**

The amount of NO(g) would decrease. Since the reaction is exothermic (ΔH < 0), increasing temperature shifts equilibrium left (Le Chatelier's principle).

**(b) Why catalyst doesn't affect equilibrium position (2 marks)**

A catalyst increases the rate of both forward and reverse reactions equally. It provides an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy but does not change the relative energies of reactants and products. Therefore, the equilibrium position (determined by thermodynamics) remains unchanged.

**(c) Effect of removing H₂O(g) using collision theory (3 marks)**

Removing H₂O(g) decreases the concentration of products. According to collision theory, this reduces the frequency of collisions between product molecules, decreasing the rate of the reverse reaction. The forward reaction rate remains unchanged initially. This creates a net forward reaction rate, causing the equilibrium to shift right and increase the concentration of NO(g) until equilibrium is re-established.

### Question 24 (3 marks)
**Explain the boiling point trend in 1-chloroalkanes**

As molar mass increases, the boiling point increases. This occurs because:
- Larger molecules have more electrons and greater surface area
- This leads to stronger dispersion forces (van der Waals forces) between molecules
- More energy is required to overcome these intermolecular forces during boiling
- Therefore, higher molar mass compounds have higher boiling points

### Question 25 (3 marks)
**Compare pH of 0.2 mol L⁻¹ HCl (pH = 0.70) and 0.2 mol L⁻¹ HCN (pH = 5.0)**

HCN has a higher pH because it is a weak acid while HCl is a strong acid. HCl completely ionizes in water, producing more H⁺ ions and thus a lower pH. HCN only partially ionizes:

HCN(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ H₃O⁺(aq) + CN⁻(aq)

This equilibrium lies far to the left, producing fewer H⁺ ions and resulting in a higher pH.

### Question 26 (4 marks)
**Enthalpy of neutralization calculation**

**(a) Heat energy released (2 marks)**

**Calculation:**
- Total mass = 100.7 g + 102.0 g = 202.7 g
- ΔT = 24.4°C - 21.1°C = 3.3°C (average initial temperature)
- q = mcΔT = 202.7 g × 4.18 J g⁻¹°C⁻¹ × 3.3°C = 2794 J ≈ 2.8 × 10³ J

**(b) Enthalpy of neutralization (2 marks)**

**Calculation:**
- Heat released = 2.6 × 10³ J
- Moles of limiting reagent = 0.100 L × 0.50 mol L⁻¹ = 0.050 mol
- ΔH = -q/n = -2.6 × 10³ J / 0.050 mol = -52,000 J mol⁻¹ = -52 kJ mol⁻¹

### Question 27 (7 marks)
**Propanol isomers**

**(a) Two isomers of propanol (2 marks)**

```
Propan-1-ol:          Propan-2-ol:
    H   H   H             H   H   H
    |   |   |             |   |   |
H-C-C-C-OH           H-C-C-C-H
    |   |   |             |   |   |
    H   H   H             H  OH   H
```

**(b) Using ¹³C NMR to identify isomers (2 marks)**

¹³C NMR would show different numbers of carbon signals:
- Propan-1-ol would show 3 different carbon signals (all carbons in different environments)
- Propan-2-ol would show 2 different carbon signals (the two end carbons are equivalent)

**(c) Oxidation reactions (3 marks)**

**Propan-1-ol oxidation:**
CH₃CH₂CH₂OH + [O] → CH₃CH₂CHO + H₂O
Conditions: K₂Cr₂O₇/H₂SO₄, heat

**Propan-2-ol oxidation:**
CH₃CHOHCH₃ + [O] → CH₃COCH₃ + H₂O
Conditions: K₂Cr₂O₇/H₂SO₄, heat

Primary alcohol oxidizes to aldehyde, secondary alcohol oxidizes to ketone.

### Question 28 (5 marks)
**Iron content determination**

**(a) Brown precipitate at step 3 (1 mark)**

Iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃

**(b) Percentage of iron in original sample (4 marks)**

**Calculation:**
- Mass of Fe₂O₃ = 4.21 g
- Molar mass of Fe₂O₃ = 159.69 g mol⁻¹
- Moles of Fe₂O₃ = 4.21 g ÷ 159.69 g mol⁻¹ = 0.02637 mol
- Moles of Fe = 2 × 0.02637 mol = 0.05274 mol
- Mass of Fe = 0.05274 mol × 55.845 g mol⁻¹ = 2.944 g
- Percentage of Fe = (2.944 g ÷ 4.32 g) × 100% = 68.1%

### Question 29 (5 marks)
**Enthalpy of combustion of alcohols**

**(a) Graph and estimation (3 marks)**

[Graph would show points plotted with curved line of best fit]
From the curve, the enthalpy of combustion of butan-1-ol (4 carbons) ≈ -2100 kJ mol⁻¹

**(b) Reason for difference from published value (2 marks)**

Heat loss to surroundings during the experiment. In school laboratories, calorimeters are not perfectly insulated, so significant heat is lost to the environment rather than being measured. This results in lower measured values compared to published values obtained under ideal conditions.

### Question 30 (7 marks)
**Structure determination from spectra**

**Analysis:**
- Mass spectrum: M⁺ = 60, indicating molecular formula
- IR spectrum: C-H stretches ~2900-3000 cm⁻¹, C=O stretch ~1700 cm⁻¹
- ¹H NMR: Septet (1H), singlet (3H), doublet (6H) - indicates isopropyl group
- ¹³C NMR: Shows 3 carbon signals

**Structure:**
```
    O
    ||
H₃C-C-CH(CH₃)₂
```

**Name:** 3-methylbutan-2-one (or methyl isopropyl ketone)

**Justification:**
- Molecular ion peak at m/z = 60 matches molecular formula C₄H₈O
- IR shows C=O stretch confirming ketone
- ¹H NMR pattern (septet-doublet-singlet) confirms isopropyl group adjacent to ketone
- ¹³C NMR shows 3 signals consistent with the proposed structure

### Question 31 (7 marks)
**Silver-ammonia complex equilibrium**

**(a) Suitability of precipitation titration with NaI (3 marks)**

This method is not suitable because:
- The complex ion Ag(NH₃)₂⁺ is very stable (K = 1.6 × 10⁷)
- Very little free Ag⁺ exists in equilibrium
- The concentration of free Ag⁺ would be too low to detect accurately by precipitation titration
- The endpoint would be difficult to observe due to the low Ag⁺ concentration

**(b) Equilibrium concentration of NH₃ (4 marks)**

**Calculation:**
Given: 0.010% of total silver is present as Ag⁺
- Let total silver concentration = C_total
- [Ag⁺] = 0.00010 × C_total
- [Ag(NH₃)₂⁺] = 0.99990 × C_total

From equilibrium expression:
K = [Ag(NH₃)₂⁺]/([Ag⁺][NH₃]²) = 1.6 × 10⁷

Substituting:
1.6 × 10⁷ = (0.99990 × C_total)/((0.00010 × C_total)[NH₃]²)
1.6 × 10⁷ = 0.99990/(0.00010 × [NH₃]²)
[NH₃]² = 0.99990/(0.00010 × 1.6 × 10⁷) = 0.625
[NH₃] = 0.79 mol L⁻¹

### Question 32 (8 marks)
**Citric acid concentration determination**

**(a) Concentration calculation (6 marks)**

**Step 1: Standardize NaOH**
- Mass KHP = 4.989 g
- Moles KHP = 4.989 g ÷ 204.22 g mol⁻¹ = 0.02443 mol
- Concentration KHP = 0.02443 mol ÷ 0.1000 L = 0.2443 mol L⁻¹
- Average NaOH volume = (27.20 + 27.60)/2 = 27.40 mL (excluding outliers)
- Moles KHP in 25.00 mL = 0.2443 mol L⁻¹ × 0.02500 L = 0.006108 mol
- Concentration NaOH = 0.006108 mol ÷ 0.02740 L = 0.2229 mol L⁻¹

**Step 2: Calculate citric acid concentration**
- Moles NaOH used = 0.2229 mol L⁻¹ × 0.01310 L = 0.002920 mol
- Moles citric acid = 0.002920 mol ÷ 3 = 0.000973 mol (triprotic)
- Concentration in diluted sample = 0.000973 mol ÷ 0.02500 L = 0.03892 mol L⁻¹
- Concentration in original drink = 0.03892 mol L⁻¹ × (250.0/75.00) = 0.130 mol L⁻¹

**(b) Effect of not removing CO₂ (2 marks)**

The calculated concentration would be higher than the actual value. CO₂ forms carbonic acid in solution, which would consume some of the NaOH titrant, leading to an overestimation of the citric acid concentration.

### Question 33 (8 marks)
**Chemical synthesis process design**

**Example: Synthesis of ethyl acetate (ethyl ethanoate)**

**Chemical equation:**
CH₃COOH + C₂H₅OH ⇌ CH₃COOC₂H₅ + H₂O

**Selection of reagents:**
- Ethanoic acid (acetic acid) and ethanol as reactants
- Concentrated sulfuric acid as catalyst (dehydrating agent)
- Use excess of one reactant (typically ethanol) to drive equilibrium forward

**Reaction conditions:**
- Heat under reflux at ~80°C to increase reaction rate
- Use reflux condenser to prevent loss of volatile reactants
- Reaction time: 30-45 minutes
- Maintain anhydrous conditions to prevent hydrolysis

**Potential hazards and safety precautions:**
- Flammable liquids (ethanol, ethyl acetate) - no naked flames, use heating mantle
- Corrosive sulfuric acid - wear safety goggles, gloves, work in fume hood
- Toxic vapors - adequate ventilation, fume hood
- Hot apparatus - allow cooling before handling

**Yield and purity considerations:**
- Theoretical yield limited by equilibrium position (~60-70%)
- Purification by distillation to separate product from reactants and water
- Washing with sodium carbonate solution to remove acid impurities
- Drying with anhydrous sodium sulfate
- Final distillation to obtain pure ethyl acetate (b.p. 77°C)
- Yield can be improved by removing water as it forms (Le Chatelier's principle)

### Question 34 (4 marks)
**Pool chlorine calculation**

**Given:**
- OCl⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ HOCl(aq) + OH⁻(aq)
- K = 3.33 × 10⁻⁷
- pH = 7.5, [HOCl] required = 1.3 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹
- Pool volume = 1.00 × 10⁴ L

**Calculation:**
- pOH = 14 - 7.5 = 6.5
- [OH⁻] = 10⁻⁶·⁵ = 3.16 × 10⁻⁷ mol L⁻¹
- K = [HOCl][OH⁻]/[OCl⁻]
- [OCl⁻] = [HOCl][OH⁻]/K = (1.3 × 10⁻⁴)(3.16 × 10⁻⁷)/(3.33 × 10⁻⁷) = 1.24 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹
- Total moles OCl⁻ needed = 1.24 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹ × 1.00 × 10⁴ L = 1.24 mol
- Volume of 2.0 mol L⁻¹ NaOCl = 1.24 mol ÷ 2.0 mol L⁻¹ = 0.62 L

### Question 35 (5 marks)
**Kₛₚ of strontium hydroxide**

**Given:**
- 80.0 mL of 1.50 mol L⁻¹ Sr(NO₃)₂
- 80.0 mL of 0.855 mol L⁻¹ NaOH
- Mass of Sr(OH)₂ precipitate = 3.93 g

**Calculation:**
- Moles Sr²⁺ = 0.0800 L × 1.50 mol L⁻¹ = 0.120 mol
- Moles OH⁻ = 0.0800 L × 0.855 mol L⁻¹ = 0.0684 mol
- Stoichiometry: Sr²⁺ + 2OH⁻ → Sr(OH)₂
- OH⁻ is limiting reagent: 0.0684 mol OH⁻ ÷ 2 = 0.0342 mol Sr(OH)₂ theoretical
- Actual moles Sr(OH)₂ = 3.93 g ÷ 121.63 g mol⁻¹ = 0.0323 mol
- Moles Sr(OH)₂ dissolved = 0.0342 - 0.0323 = 0.0019 mol
- Total volume = 160.0 mL = 0.1600 L
- [Sr²⁺] = [Sr(OH)₂ dissolved] = 0.0019 mol ÷ 0.1600 L = 0.0119 mol L⁻¹
- [OH⁻] = 2 × 0.0119 = 0.0238 mol L⁻¹
- Kₛₚ = [Sr²⁺][OH⁻]² = (0.0119)(0.0238)² = 6.7 × 10⁻⁶

### Question 36 (4 marks)
**Evaporation in open beaker vs sealed bottle**

**Enthalpy considerations:**
The evaporation process H₂O(l) → H₂O(g) has ΔH > 0 (endothermic) in both cases. Energy is required to break hydrogen bonds and overcome intermolecular forces during phase change.

**Entropy considerations:**
Evaporation increases entropy (ΔS > 0) as liquid water molecules become more disordered gas molecules with greater freedom of movement.

**Differences in evaporation:**
- **Open beaker**: Water vapor can escape to the atmosphere. Evaporation continues until all water evaporates because the system is open and equilibrium cannot be established.
- **Sealed bottle**: Water vapor cannot escape. Initially, evaporation occurs, but as vapor pressure builds up, condensation also begins. Eventually, dynamic equilibrium is established where evaporation rate equals condensation rate. The amount of liquid water remains constant at equilibrium.

The key difference is that the open system cannot reach equilibrium due to continuous removal of water vapor, while the closed system reaches equilibrium when the vapor pressure equals the equilibrium vapor pressure at that temperature.
