# 2021 HSC Physics - Complete Worked Solutions

## Section I - Multiple Choice Questions (20 marks)

### Question 1 - Projectile Motion
**Answer: B**

A marble rolled off a horizontal bench undergoes projectile motion. The horizontal velocity determines the range, while the vertical motion (height of fall) determines the time of flight.

- Time of flight depends only on the vertical height: t = √(2h/g)
- Range = horizontal velocity × time of flight
- Rolling at slower speed → smaller horizontal velocity → smaller range
- Time of flight remains unchanged (same height)

### Question 2 - Electric Fields
**Answer: D**

A positively charged particle in an electric field experiences force in the direction of the field.
- Electric field lines point from positive to negative
- Force on positive charge: F = qE (same direction as field)
- From the diagram, field points downward
- Therefore, force is down the page

### Question 3 - Standard Model
**Answer: D**

Fundamental particles in the Standard Model include:
- Leptons (electron, muon, tau, neutrinos)
- Quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top, bottom)
- Gauge bosons (photon, W, Z, gluon)

Proton is a composite particle (made of quarks: uud), not fundamental.

### Question 4 - Special Relativity
**Answer: B**

In special relativity, the speed of light is constant for all observers.
- Length contracts for moving observer
- Time dilates (different intervals measured)
- Momentum is frame-dependent
- Speed of electromagnetic waves (radio pulses) = c for all observers

### Question 5 - Stellar Spectra
**Answer: A**

The spectrum shows dark lines (absorption lines) against a continuous background.
- Stars produce continuous spectra with absorption lines
- Dark lines (Y) indicate absorption of specific wavelengths
- Discharge tubes produce emission lines (bright lines)

### Question 6 - Nuclear Fusion
**Answer: A**

Nuclear fusion process: proton + proton → deuterium + positron + neutrino
- Conservation of mass number: 1 + 1 = 2 + 0 + 0
- Conservation of charge: 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 0
- R has mass number 2, atomic number 1 → H-2 (deuterium)

### Question 7 - Transformers
**Answer: D**

For ideal transformers: Ip/Is = Ns/Np
- Given: Is = 4Ip
- Therefore: Ip/(4Ip) = Ns/Np → 1/4 = Ns/Np
- Np/Ns = 4/1 → step down transformer
- Primary has more turns than secondary

### Question 8 - Wave Optics
**Answer: D**

Bright spot in shadow center demonstrates Fresnel diffraction.
- Light diffracts around circular obstacle
- Constructive interference at center creates bright spot
- Combination of diffraction and interference effects

### Question 9 - Gravitational Potential Energy
**Answer: C**

Moving mass M from equidistant position toward one star:
- Initially at equal distances → minimum potential energy
- Moving closer to one star → increasing potential energy
- Gravitational PE = -Gm₁m₂/r (becomes less negative as r decreases for one star)

### Question 10 - Electromagnetic Induction
**Answer: A**

Moving magnet induces eddy currents in copper block.
- Lenz's law: induced effects oppose the change
- Magnet moving right → induced currents create field opposing motion
- Force on copper block is to the left (opposing magnet's motion)

### Question 11 - Wien's Law
**Answer: A**

Wien's displacement law: λmax = b/T, where b = 2.90 × 10⁻³ m·K
- T = 310 K
- λmax = (2.90 × 10⁻³)/310 = 9.35 × 10⁻⁶ m ≈ 9.3 × 10⁻⁶ m

### Question 12 - DC Motor Back EMF
**Answer: A**

Back EMF in DC motor: ε = BLv = k×ω (linear relationship)
- Back EMF proportional to angular velocity
- Graph shows linear relationship through origin

### Question 13 - Hydrogen Emission
**Answer: A**

Shortest wavelength corresponds to highest energy transition.
- E = hf = hc/λ → shorter λ means higher E
- Transition W: n=5 to n=1 (largest energy difference)
- ΔE = 13.6 eV(1/1² - 1/5²) = 13.6(1 - 1/25) = 13.1 eV

### Question 14 - Newton's Third Law
**Answer: A**

Newton's third law: action-reaction pairs are equal and opposite.
- Earth and Moon exert equal forces on each other
- F = GMm/r² (same for both)
- Both accelerate toward each other (different accelerations due to different masses)

### Question 15 - Polarization
**Answer: C**

Malus's law for consecutive polarizers:
- I₁ = I₀/2 (first polarizer always reduces unpolarized light by half)
- I₂ = I₁ cos²θ (depends on angle between polarizers)
- Rotating first polarizer changes θ → only I₂ changes

### Question 16 - Mass-Energy Equivalence
**Answer: B**

E = mc², so Δm = ΔE/c²
- Power = 3.85 × 10²⁸ W
- Energy per minute = 3.85 × 10²⁸ × 60 = 2.31 × 10³⁰ J
- Δm = (2.31 × 10³⁰)/(3 × 10⁸)² = 2.57 × 10¹³ kg

### Question 17 - Magnetic Forces
**Answer: D**

AC current in parallel conductors creates time-varying magnetic forces.
- Same direction current → attraction
- Opposite direction current → repulsion
- AC current continuously reverses → continuous reversal of force direction

### Question 18 - Charged Particle Motion
**Answer: A**

Charged particle in electric field:
- Initially: gravity only (parabolic path)
- Switch open: no electric field → continues under gravity only
- Path continues as parabola with same curvature

### Question 19 - Radioactive Decay
**Answer: A**

Rh-106 beta decay with half-life of 30 seconds:
- Current I ∝ number of radioactive nuclei (decreases with time)
- Stopping voltage Vs depends on maximum kinetic energy of β particles
- β energy spectrum unchanged → Vs remains constant
- Only the intensity (current) decreases

### Question 20 - Photoelectric Effect in Magnetic Field
**Answer: B**

Photoelectron circular motion: r = mv/(eB)
- Initial energy: E₁ = 2f
- KEmax = E₁ - f = 2f - f = f
- v₁ = √(2KEmax/m) = √(2f/m)
- r₁ = m√(2f/m)/(eB) = √(2fm)/(eB)

Double photon energy: E₂ = 4f
- KEmax = 4f - f = 3f
- v₂ = √(6f/m)
- r₂ = √(6fm)/(eB) = √3 × √(2fm)/(eB) = √3 × r₁

## Section II - Extended Response Questions (80 marks)

### Question 21 - DC Motor (4 marks)

**(a) Maximum torque calculation (2 marks)**

For a rectangular loop in magnetic field:
τ = BINA

Where:
- B = 0.40 T
- I = 14 A  
- N = 1 turn
- A = 0.10 × 0.07 = 0.007 m²

τmax = 0.40 × 14 × 1 × 0.007 = 0.0392 N⋅m ≈ **0.039 N⋅m**

**(b) Torque variation (2 marks)**

As the loop rotates through half a rotation:
- Maximum torque occurs when loop plane is parallel to magnetic field
- Torque decreases as the loop rotates, following τ = τmax cos θ
- Torque becomes zero when loop plane is perpendicular to field
- Torque reverses direction and increases to maximum in opposite direction
- The magnitude varies from maximum to zero and back to maximum

### Question 22 - Circular Motion (3 marks)

**Angular velocity comparison:**
Both points X and Y have the same angular velocity (ω) because they rotate together on the same disc. ω = 2π/T, where T is the period of rotation.

**Instantaneous velocity comparison:**
Point X has twice the instantaneous velocity of point Y. Since v = rω and X is twice as far from the center as Y:
- vX = 2r × ω
- vY = r × ω
- Therefore: vX = 2vY

The instantaneous velocities are always tangent to the circular paths at each point.

### Question 23 - Millikan and Thomson (4 marks)

**Thomson's method:**
Thomson used crossed electric and magnetic fields to determine the charge-to-mass ratio (e/m) of electrons. He balanced electric and magnetic forces on electron beams in cathode ray tubes. When FE = FB, the beam traveled straight: eE = evB, giving v = E/B. By also measuring deflection with only electric field, he calculated e/m.

**Millikan's method:**
Millikan used electric fields to suspend charged oil droplets against gravity. By balancing gravitational and electric forces: mg = qE, he could determine the charge q on individual droplets. Combined with Thomson's e/m ratio, this allowed calculation of both electron mass and charge separately. Millikan found charge was quantized in multiples of elementary charge e.

### Question 24 - Electromagnetic Induction (3 marks)

Using Faraday's law: ε = -N(ΔΦ/Δt)

Where:
- N = 35 turns
- A = 0.02 m²
- ΔB = 0 - 0.15 = -0.15 T
- Δt = 0.4 s

ΔΦ = A × ΔB = 0.02 × (-0.15) = -0.003 Wb

ε = -35 × (-0.003/0.4) = -35 × (-0.0075) = **0.26 V**

The magnitude of the induced emf is **0.26 V**.

### Question 25 - Satellite Orbits (5 marks)

**(a) Energy changes (2 marks)**
1. **Kinetic energy increases** - the satellite gains speed during launch
2. **Gravitational potential energy increases** - the satellite moves away from Mars' surface to higher altitude

**(b) Orbital radius calculation (3 marks)**

For geostationary orbit: T = 24 hours 40 minutes = 88,800 s

Using Kepler's third law: T² = (4π²/GM)r³

Rearranging: r³ = GMT²/(4π²)

Where:
- G = 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ N⋅m²/kg²
- M = 6.39 × 10²³ kg
- T = 88,800 s

r³ = (6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ × 6.39 × 10²³ × (88,800)²)/(4π²)
r³ = (6.67 × 6.39 × 7.885 × 10³⁵)/(39.48)
r³ = 8.45 × 10²⁰ m³

r = **2.04 × 10⁷ m** (20,400 km from Mars' center)

### Question 26 - Planck's Constant (6 marks)

**(a) Graph (3 marks)**
[Graph should show voltage (y-axis) vs frequency (x-axis) with four data points plotted and a straight line of best fit through them, showing positive linear relationship]

**(b) Better method justification (3 marks)**

Using only data point 1 would give an inaccurate result because:
1. **Single point measurement errors** - any experimental error in one measurement significantly affects the result
2. **No account for systematic errors** - a single point cannot identify or compensate for systematic experimental errors
3. **Line of best fit method is superior** - using all data points and the gradient of the best fit line minimizes random errors and provides a more reliable value for h/qe, thus giving a better value for Planck's constant

The gradient method uses all available data and statistical averaging to improve accuracy.

### Question 27 - Magnetic Levitation (6 marks)

**(a) Diagram (3 marks)**
[Diagram should show:
- Horizontal rod with current I flowing along its length
- Magnetic field B pointing horizontally perpendicular to current
- Magnetic force FB pointing upward (using right-hand rule)
- Weight force mg pointing downward
- Clear labels for all forces and field directions]

**(b) Maximum mass calculation (3 marks)**

For levitation, magnetic force must equal weight:
FB = mg

Magnetic force on current-carrying conductor: FB = BIL
For unit length: FB/L = BI

Setting up equilibrium per unit length:
BI = (m/L)g

Therefore: m/L = BI/g

Given:
- B = 1.2 T
- I = 2.3 A
- g = 9.8 m/s²

m/L = (1.2 × 2.3)/9.8 = 2.76/9.8 = **0.282 kg/m**

This represents the maximum mass per unit length that can be levitated with the given current and magnetic field strength.

### Question 28 - Special Relativity (5 marks)

**(a) Distance calculation (3 marks)**

First, find the velocity using time dilation:
Δt = γΔt₀, where γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²)

Given:
- Δt = 15 years (Earth time)
- Δt₀ = 9.4 years (proper time)

γ = 15/9.4 = 1.596

1.596 = 1/√(1 - v²/c²)
√(1 - v²/c²) = 1/1.596 = 0.626
1 - v²/c² = 0.392
v²/c² = 0.608
v = 0.78c

Distance = velocity × time = 0.78c × 15 years = **11.7 light-years**

**(b) Maximum velocity limitation (2 marks)**

Special relativity imposes the speed of light as a universal speed limit because:
- As velocity approaches c, the Lorentz factor γ approaches infinity
- This means infinite energy would be required to accelerate any massive object to the speed of light
- The speed of light represents an asymptotic limit that can be approached but never reached by objects with mass

### Question 29 - Atomic Models (5 marks)

**Bohr Model:**
The electron is treated as a classical particle orbiting the nucleus in fixed, quantized circular orbits. It has definite position and momentum, following classical mechanics within quantum constraints (quantized angular momentum: L = nℏ).

**de Broglie Model:**
The electron exhibits wave-particle duality with an associated wavelength λ = h/p. Electron waves must form standing wave patterns around the nucleus, with the orbit circumference containing an integer number of wavelengths for stable orbits.

**Schrödinger Model:**
The electron is described by a probability wave function ψ that gives the probability density |ψ|² of finding the electron at any location. The electron has no definite trajectory but exists in probability clouds (orbitals) around the nucleus. Position and momentum cannot be simultaneously determined (uncertainty principle).

The progression shows evolution from particle (Bohr) → wave-particle (de Broglie) → pure quantum probability (Schrödinger).

### Question 30 - Electric Fields (5 marks)

**(a) Kinetic energy graph (2 marks)**
[Graph should show kinetic energy starting at zero and increasing linearly with distance, complementing the decreasing potential energy curve. The two curves should be mirror images, with KE + PE = constant]

**(b) Electron motion comparison (3 marks)**

The electron would behave differently from the proton because:

1. **Opposite charge effect** - The electron (negative charge) would be attracted to the positive plate and repelled by the negative plate, opposite to the proton's behavior

2. **Direction of motion** - The electron would accelerate toward the positive plate (upward in the diagram) rather than toward the negative plate like the proton

3. **Same magnitude of acceleration** - Since F = qE and both particles have the same magnitude of charge, they experience the same magnitude of force and acceleration (ignoring the small mass difference effect)

The electron follows the same energy conservation principles but moves in the opposite direction due to its negative charge.

### Question 31 - Electromagnetic Induction (7 marks)

When the switch on cart 1 is closed:

**Initial current flow:**
- Current flows through solenoid 1, creating a magnetic field
- Galvanometer G₁ shows current flow as the circuit is completed
- The changing magnetic field in solenoid 1 induces an emf in solenoid 2

**Induced effects in cart 2:**
- By Faraday's law, the changing flux in solenoid 2 induces an emf
- This creates a current in solenoid 2's circuit, registered by galvanometer G₂
- By Lenz's law, this induced current opposes the change causing it

**Cart movements:**
- The magnetic field from solenoid 1 interacts with the induced current in solenoid 2
- This creates forces between the solenoids (Newton's third law)
- Cart 1 experiences a force in one direction, cart 2 in the opposite direction
- Since cart 1 has twice the mass of cart 2, cart 2 will have twice the acceleration of cart 1
- The carts will move apart with momenta equal in magnitude but opposite in direction

**Observations:**
- G₁ shows steady current (DC source)
- G₂ shows induced current (may be transient depending on whether current in solenoid 1 is still changing)
- Both carts begin moving apart, with cart 2 moving faster than cart 1

### Question 32 - Hubble's Law (5 marks)

**Similarities to Hubble's observations:**
- **Distance-velocity relationship** - Both show that more distant objects move away faster
- **Proportional expansion** - In both cases, doubling of distance suggests uniform expansion
- **Universal expansion** - All marked points move away from the fixed reference point

**Limitations of the model:**
- **Two-dimensional vs three-dimensional** - The elastic model is 2D while universe expansion is 3D
- **Fixed reference point** - The elastic has a fixed end, but in universe expansion there is no fixed center
- **Stretching vs space expansion** - The elastic stretches through existing space, while universal expansion involves the expansion of space itself
- **Scale factors** - The elastic model doesn't capture the continuous nature of cosmic expansion

**Justification:**
The model demonstrates the key concept that more distant objects recede faster, which led Hubble to conclude the universe is expanding. However, it oversimplifies the three-dimensional, centerless nature of cosmic expansion. The model is useful for understanding the basic relationship but doesn't fully represent the cosmological reality.

### Question 33 - Wave-Particle Duality (9 marks)

**Experiment A - Wave Model Support:**

Experiment A demonstrates the wave nature of light through interference:
- Double-slit setup produces interference pattern
- Fringe spacing: x = λD/d = (400 × 10⁻⁹ × 3.0)/(5.0 × 10⁻⁵) = 0.024 m = 2.4 cm
- The formation of bright and dark fringes requires wave interference
- Constructive interference (bright): path difference = nλ
- Destructive interference (dark): path difference = (n + ½)λ
- This pattern is impossible to explain with a particle model alone

**Experiment B - Particle Model Support:**

Experiment B demonstrates the particle (photon) nature of light:
- Photon energy: E = hf = hc/λ = (6.63 × 10⁻³⁴ × 3.0 × 10⁸)/(400 × 10⁻⁹) = 4.97 × 10⁻¹⁹ J

**Analysis of results:**
- **Nickel (work function = 8.25 × 10⁻¹⁹ J)**: No photoelectrons observed because photon energy (4.97 × 10⁻¹⁹ J) < work function
- **Calcium (work function = 4.60 × 10⁻¹⁹ J)**: Photoelectrons observed because photon energy (4.97 × 10⁻¹⁹ J) > work function

**Two Models of Light:**
1. **Wave model** - Light exhibits interference, diffraction, and wave properties (Experiment A)
2. **Particle model** - Light consists of discrete energy packets (photons) that can transfer energy in quantum amounts (Experiment B)

Both experiments are necessary to demonstrate wave-particle duality - light behaves as both wave and particle depending on the experimental context.

### Question 34 - Projectile Motion (7 marks)

**(a) Kinetic energy analysis (4 marks)**

**At t₀ (launch):** KE = 864 J
- Mass has both horizontal and vertical velocity components
- Represents initial kinetic energy from launch conditions

**At t₁:** KE = 284 J (minimum value)
- This occurs at the highest point of trajectory
- Vertical velocity component = 0 at maximum height
- Only horizontal velocity component remains: KE = ½mv²ₓ
- Since vₓ = 13.76 m/s: KEₘᵢₙ = ½ × 3.0 × (13.76)² = 284 J ✓

**At t₂ (impact):** KE = 1393 J (maximum value)
- Mass has fallen back down, gaining vertical velocity
- Total kinetic energy = horizontal KE + vertical KE
- Represents maximum kinetic energy just before impact
- Energy conservation: initial PE converted to additional KE

**(b) Time of flight calculation (3 marks)**

At highest point (t₁), only horizontal velocity remains:
KEₘᵢₙ = ½mv²ₓ = 284 J
½ × 3.0 × v²ₓ = 284
v²ₓ = 189.3
vₓ = 13.76 m/s ✓

At launch (t₀), total KE = 864 J:
½m(v²ₓ + v²ᵧ₀) = 864
½ × 3.0 × (189.3 + v²ᵧ₀) = 864
v²ᵧ₀ = 576 - 189.3 = 386.7
vᵧ₀ = 19.67 m/s

Time to reach maximum height: t = vᵧ₀/g = 19.67/9.8 = 2.01 s

**Total time of flight = 2 × 2.01 = 4.0 s**

### Question 35 - Nuclear Decay (6 marks)

**(a) Energy released calculation (3 marks)**

Mass defect: Δm = 238.0495u - (234.0409u + 4.0026u) = 238.0495 - 238.0435 = 0.0060u

Converting to kg: Δm = 0.0060 × 1.66 × 10⁻²⁷ kg = 9.96 × 10⁻³⁰ kg

Energy released: E = Δmc² = 9.96 × 10⁻³⁰ × (3.0 × 10⁸)² = 8.96 × 10⁻¹³ J ≈ **9.0 × 10⁻¹³ J** ✓

**(b) Total energy over 10 years (3 marks)**

Half-life = 87.7 years, so after 10 years:
λ = ln(2)/t₁/₂ = 0.693/(87.7 × 365.25 × 24 × 3600) = 2.50 × 10⁻¹⁰ s⁻¹

Number of atoms remaining after 10 years:
N(t) = N₀e⁻λt = 9.0 × 10²⁴ × e⁻²·⁵⁰×¹⁰⁻¹⁰×³·¹⁶×¹⁰⁸ = 9.0 × 10²⁴ × e⁻⁰·⁰⁷⁹ = 8.32 × 10²⁴

Number of atoms decayed = 9.0 × 10²⁴ - 8.32 × 10²⁴ = 6.8 × 10²³

Total energy = 6.8 × 10²³ × 9.0 × 10⁻¹³ = **6.1 × 10¹¹ J**
